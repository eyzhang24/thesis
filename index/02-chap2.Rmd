# Humanistic Perspective {#humanistic}

In this section, we briefly introduce ideas from science and technology studies, which track habits of thought that have fundamentally shaped the ways in which we think about and study toxicity. Our goal, here, is to contextualize exposure mixture studies — the motivation for this thesis — within larger regimes of knowledge production. We aim to recognize the limitations in current norms of understanding toxicity, in order to progress toward a study of health that better reflects the complex realities of communities who bear the burdens of toxic exposure. 

Modern scientific thinking encourages the onlooker to see objects in the world as distinct entities. For instance, when we talk about chemicals, we tend to talk about them as disconnected molecules: lead, mercury, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, etc. Clouds of pollution are conceived through their individual components, each of which becomes separated from its surroundings through the lenses of our imaginations [@myers_rendering_2015]. It is easy to accept this ontology as inevitable, but its origins can actually be located in the history of chemistry. The Industrial Revolution first turned chemistry into a profitable field, leading practitioners to become keenly interested in how structural representations of chemicals could be most useful for industrial and corporate technoscientific disciplines [@bensaude-vincent_history_1996]. Reducing chemical mixtures amidst complex environments down into discrete molecules made the quantification of their effects simpler — certain side effects or relations could be masked or hidden in technical reports. Such reports were then used by industrial lobbyists as evidence for reducing or withholding environmental regulations [@murphy_alterlife_2017]. 

These lines of thinking have filtered out of industry and into scientific studies of environmental health, which have historically been permeated by a focus on studying single chemicals. The end goal has often been to obtain mechanistic explanations of their modes of toxicity. By isolating attention to a single chemical entity within a purely biological framework, one can simplify the problem; but, in so doing, one also captures only a narrow sliver of the complex social and physical realities of exposure [@murphy_uncertain_2004]. This is not to dismiss such studies or their contributions when, in fact, they are necessary for understanding the mechanisms of exposure. Rather, we hope to acknowledge that there exist additional possibilities for the study of exposures when we shift perspective away from isolated molecules and into chemical relations. 

We start by recognizing that an object cannot exist without also taking on relations to other beings — existence implies relationality. [*finish writing this section*]

- relationality: entities cannot be understood without considering their *relationality* to other surrounding entities
  - relationality disrupts the notion of bounded objects
  - motivation for chemical mixtures: chemicals themselves are not independent from surrounding chemicals
  - motivation for chemical mixtures in the context of social epidemiology: the effects of chemicals are modulated by structural/social conditions
- relationality also disrupts Cartesian split between body and mind
  - racial hierarchy positions certain groups closer to the bounds of the corporal body, while other groups have transcended these bounds and are defined by their intellect (i.e., the mind)
  - result --> some bodies are seen as inherently more susceptible to chemical exposure, more "porous" 
  - leads to damage centered research which, while well-intentioned, inadvertently de-humanizes marginalized groups
- remedy: relationality leads into concept of alterlife, modern life is inseparable from alteration due to chemical exposure

Define chemical relations.

Within the context of exposure studies, we link this concept to practices in social epidemiology, which posit that one’s health is embodied within structural and social conditions [@krieger_theories_2001; @krieger_epidemiology_2011]. 

It is important to explore radical modes of living that make our increasingly toxic world more habitable [@nguyen_breathless_2020; @shapiro_attuning_2015]. This task does not fall purely to science — other forms of knowledge are crucial for navigating the chemical hazards of our everyday life. The responsibility of science, though, is to become aware of how such hazards are lived and experienced, in order to better inform our understanding of exposure. We argue that the methods for exposure mixture studies examined in this thesis take us one step closer to this goal. In particular, exposure mixtures account for the realities of chemicals that co-occur with other chemicals. Moreover, testing for interactions between chemicals acknowledges that the relationality of these molecules with each other might affect their modes of action. Finally, we consider potential interactions between sociodemographic covariates and chemical exposures, a previously understudied form of interaction in exposure mixture studies. In so doing, we recognize that the effects of chemical exposure can be modulated by complex and unequal social conditions. 

Chemicals — despite being inanimate objects — are not fully separable from the societal context in which they exist. become entangled in bodies that are entagled in complex social relations. 

Still, there is more work to do. We make a multitude of assumptions when reducing human livelihoods to numbers and then magnifying those numbers with models. For instance, the race variable that we use attempts to capture the full lived experience of racism within five categories. We set the response variable in our simulations as some numerical health outcome, which assumes that healthfulness and wellbeing can be represented by a one-dimensional variable. And there are certainly other factors that we have missed. So, we hope that this is the start of a conversation that continues to contend with how scientific studies of exposure can help us better make sense of our new toxic realities.
