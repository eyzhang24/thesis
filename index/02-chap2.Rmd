# Humanistic Perspective {#humanistic}

<!-- In our modern world, we are constantly exposed to toxins, permeating our bodies through our food, skin, and lungs. Studies of environmental hazards have typically focused on identifying the health effects of single exposures. However, humans are invariably exposed to whole mixtures of exposures, and analyses of their joint effects can provide more accurate estimates of true health risk. The study of mixtures presents unique statistical challenges, though. My thesis explores the theory of emerging Bayesian regression techniques for quantifying the health risks of mixtures of pollutants. Specifically, I am using simulation studies to assess how modern statistical methods can detect interactions between multiple pollutants, and between pollutants and sociodemographic factors. I am keenly interested in combating habits of thought that associate outcomes with single, isolated causes, and progressing toward a study of health that acknowledges the relationality of our bodies to the environment and to each other.  -->

List of loose ideas:

- goal of modernism: define single causes for single effects
  - study chemicals in isolation to obtain purely mechanistic explanation of their toxicity
- contrast with idea of relationality: entities cannot be understood without considering their *relationality* to other surrounding entities
  - relationality disrupts the notion of bounded objects
  - motivation for chemical mixtures: chemicals themselves are not independent from surrounding chemicals
  - motivation for chemical mixtures in the context of social epidemiology: the effects of chemicals are modulated by structural/social conditions
- relationality also disrupts Cartesian split between body and mind
  - racial hierarchy positions certain groups closer to the bounds of the corporal body, while other groups have transcended these bounds and are defined by their intellect (i.e., the mind)
  - result --> some bodies are seen as inherently more susceptible to chemical exposure, more "porous" 
  - leads to damage centered research which, while well-intentioned, inadvertently de-humanizes marginalized groups
- remedy: relationality leads into concept of alterlife, modern life is inseparable from alteration due to chemical exposure
