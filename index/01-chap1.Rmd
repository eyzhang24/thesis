# Introduction {#intro}
<!--
Each chapter file must start with a chapter header (e.g., # Chapter name). Notice we have also included a label after the chapter name ({# intro}) so we can refer back to this chapter later in the text if want to (e.g., by using \@ref(intro)). This also helps you debut potential issues as you knit.

You can knit chapters all at once using the index file, or individually. When you knit a single chapter, every other chapter will have a one-sentence placeholder to make knitting easier.

You can re-name each chapter file (e.g., change this filename from "01-chap1.Rmd" to "01-introduction.Rmd"), just make sure you also update the filename in the list of rmd files in _bookdown.yml.

The introduction should provide an overview of the work you set out to do and provide structure for the remainder of the document.

## Resources for new(er) users {#resources}

If you are new to bookdown, the package this thesis template is built on, I highly recommend bookmarking Chapter 2 of Yihui Xie's book, ["bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown"](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-syntax.html) as a reference for **R** and LaTeX components useful to writing your thesis, including 

* _R Markdown_ syntax
* math expressions
* numbering and referencing equations
* special chunks for *theorems*, *definitions*, *proofs*, etc.
* captioning and referencing figures
* captioning and referencing tables
* in-text citations and bibliographies


### What to expect

While Yihui Xie's books is the best resource, the remainder of this document will include examples of commonly used formatting. The amherst thesis github repo also contains a guide on dealing with all the different files in this thesis directory.

The field of preventive epidemiology involves the identification of potentially modifiable risk factors that contribute to the burden of disease within human populations. Environmental epidemiology, in particular, considers the effect of environmental exposures — chemical or otherwise — which have been increasingly recognized as crucial determinants of human health (Vineis, 2018). Understanding the health effects of exposure to chemical pollutants is especially timely. It has been estimated that human activity releases chemicals at a rate of 220 billion tons per annum (Cribb, 2016). As a result, exposure to low levels of pollutants has become an inevitable peril of daily life. Scholars warn that such conditions of cumulative chronic toxicity pose an acute risk to the wellbeing of humans and our living environment (Naidu et al., 2021). To this, the quantification of such risks through environmental epidemiology studies can prompt critical regulatory action.

Studies concerning chemical pollutants in environmental epidemiology have historically focused on elucidating the effect and mechanisms of single exposures. However, humans are invariably exposed to numerous complex chemical mixtures which together contribute to the progression of adverse health outcomes — risk assessments of single pollutants likely fail to capture the true consequences of these complex exposures (Heys et al., 2016). Assessing mixtures of chemicals can also have more direct implications for public health interventions. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) currently passes regulations for individual pollutants. In practice, though, regulation occurs by controlling the source of pollution, which is responsible for the production of a whole mixture of chemicals with specific joint effects on human health. As a result, the National Academies of Science has advocated for a multipollutant regulatory approach, which is likely to be more protective of human health (Committee on Incorporating 21st Century Science into Risk-Based Evaluations et al., 2017). 

Hence, there are clear practical motivations for the development of studies and methodologies that examine the health effects of exposure to co-occurring chemical mixtures, hereafter referred to as exposure mixtures. However, expanding the focus of analysis from one exposure to multiple exposures introduces unique statistical challenges. In addition to the issue of small effect sizes and small sample sizes present in all exposure analyses, multiple exposure analyses must also contend with high-dimensionality, collinearity, non-linear effects, and non-additive interactions (Yu et al., 2022). The classic multiple linear regression framework fails to capture the true effects in this setting. In the past few years, a wide variety of statistical methods have been developed to overcome these challenges (Gibson et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2022), which have been accompanied by a host of comparative simulation studies for general mixture scenarios (e.g., Hoskovec et al., 2021; Lazarevic et al., 2020; Pesenti et al., 2023). However, there is not yet conclusive guidance about the ability of these methods to conduct inference on non-additive interactions between exposures. 

The goal of this thesis is to explore the theory of emerging Bayesian regression techniques for quantifying complex interactions between environmental exposures. **[clarify goals]**

In an age where anthropogenic actions have radically reshaped the earth, humanistic inquiry can offer critical insights into our place within a rapidly evolving environment. I begin in Chapter 2 by contextualizing this thesis with a brief overview of cultural and social understandings of the topic of environmental exposures. Chapter 3 provides background on X Bayesian methods for analyzing exposure mixtures. Chapter 4 assesses the performance of these methods for conducting inference on non-additive interactions using a simulation study based on **X**. Chapter 5 explores an application on **X** data **[TBD]**. I conclude with a discussion of the implications of this work for the future study of complex interactions in exposure mixture studies.
