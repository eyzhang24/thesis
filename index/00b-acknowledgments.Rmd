Next, I am indebted to so many people, without whom this thesis would not have been possible. Thank you so much to my thesis advisor, Amy Wagaman, for her tireless support. Your encouragement, feedback, and guidance gave me the confidence to see this project through. Thank you to Alex Keil for first inspiring my interest in exposure mixture studies and thereafter providing invaluable advice on my ideas. Thank you to Shu-Min Liao for her advice on copulas, and to Victoria Nguyen for her guidance on how to think humanistically about toxicity. Thank you to Doug Hall for troubleshooting my code for the cluster with me. I would also like to acknowledge Brittney Bailey, whose early support encouraged me to first pursue a statistics major, and then to write this thesis. And to everyone in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics — the faculty, staff, and my peers — thank you for shaping the wonderful journey that I've taken through statistics at Amherst. 

Finally, I want to express my gratitude for my family for their love and support. I would not be here without you. Thank you to my mom for believing in me and giving me the opportunity to grow and take risks. Thank you to my friends for all their support and for listening to me talk on and on about statistics. And to Sara, I am so grateful to you for always encouraging me to keep going. Thank you for sticking by my side through it all.
