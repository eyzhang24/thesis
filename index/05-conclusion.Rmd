# Conclusion {-}

We will continue to encounter novel chemical entities in our day-to-day lives. 

Statistical studies of the health risks associated with exposure to chemical pollutants are critical for making modern toxic landscapes more habitable. 

As discussed in Chapter \@ref(humanistic), 

Our simulation study in Chapter \@ref(sims) illustrates the challenges of detecting interactions. Still, we were able to achieve high sensitivities using BKMR and BSR to detect interactions between marginally significant chemicals. For 

There can be differences in the performance of BKMR and BSR, but neither consistently outperforms the other. Thus, as BKMR is generally more reliable for univariate effects, and also computationally less intensive, we recommend BKMR for 

This thesis summarizes the current capabilities of modern Bayesian statistical methods for characterizing complex interactions in exposure mixture studies. In particular, we highlight that such methods are under-powered for detecting potential interactions between 

Future work...

- analyses would be improved if three-way fdr's were included and BSR run-times recorded
- going forward, change design of simulations study should try three-way interactions and multicollinearity on cases where the chemicals themselves are significant
- figure out method of formal inference for BSR
- identify difficulty of detecting interactions between race and exposure
- continue to explore how studies of exposure can best protect the health and well-being of communities who live and experience the effects of toxicity
- see what happens with even more chemicals

Progressing toward a study of exposure that considers how bodies are related to the environment and to each other. As blah blah said, something something entanglement. But this is better!
