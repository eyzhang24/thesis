## Past simulation studies

Lit review of past sim studies which include bayesian regression approaches + others, note how they haven't focused on interactions 

## Methods

What are our aims? 

### Models

Models compared, specify the parameters for each (justify them!)

- MLR
- MLR with known form of interactions specified
- BKMR with component-wise
- BKMR with hierarchical
- BMIM? extension of BKMR with hierarchical 
- BSR

### MADRES data

- cite original study design paper
- cite Howe et al. 2021, which applied BKMR and BSR to this data, what did they find? 

### Simulating data

- use original predictor values in MADRES data. allows us to explore these methods on real-world data
- simulate outcome using a formula w/ different types of interaction
- change effect size (three levels?)
- change nature of interaction (mathematical formulation, two- or three-way, b/t just exposures or b/t exposures and covariates)

### Model assessment

- how many times is interaction picked up? 

## Results

- figures + tables w/ model performance
