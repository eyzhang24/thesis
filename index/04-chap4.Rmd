## Past simulation studies

Lit review of past sim studies which include bayesian regression approaches + others, note how they haven't focused on interactions + recent models

- @lazarevic_performance_2020 compares a braod range methods for variable selection (including bkmr)
- @hoskovec_model_2021 compares general performance of broad range of methods (including bkmr)
- @pesenti_comparative_2023 compares three bayesian approaches for variable selection (including bkmr and bsr)
- @lampa_identification_2014 study of interactions only w/ bayesian additive reg trees
- @barrera-gomez_systematic_2017 study of interaction effects, does not include more recent developments
- @keil_quantile-based_2020 ex. simulation study w/ birth weights

## Methods

What are our aims? 

### MADRES data

- @bastain_study_2019 original study design paper
- @howe_prenatal_2020 applied BKMR and BSR to this data, what did they find? 

### Simulating data

- use original predictor values in MADRES data. allows us to explore these methods on predictors with realistic correlation structure
- simulate outcome using a formula w/ different types of interaction
- change effect size (three levels?)
- change nature of interaction (mathematical formulation, two- or three-way, b/t just exposures or b/t exposures and covariates)
- take into account collinear structure (interactions b/t correlated exposures or uncorrelated exposures?)


### Models

Software: @bobb_statistical_2018 on CRAN, @antonelli_estimating_2020 on GitHub

Models compared, specify the parameters for each (justify them!)

- MLR
- MLR with known form of interactions specified
- BKMR with component-wise
- BKMR with hierarchical
- BMIM? extension of BKMR with hierarchical 
- BSR

check convergence with trace plots

### Model assessment

- how many times is interaction picked up? 
- potentially explore mpower package

## Results

- example output from representative model 
- figures + tables w/ model performance
