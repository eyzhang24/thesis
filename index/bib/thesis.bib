	abstract = {Background: There is growing interest in examining the simultaneous effects of multiple exposures and, more generally, the effects of mixtures of exposures, as part of the exposome concept (being defined as the totality of human environmental exposures from conception onwards). Uncovering such combined effects is challenging owing to the large number of exposures, several of them being highly correlated. We performed a simulation study in an exposome context to compare the performance of several statistical methods that have been proposed to detect statistical interactions.
Methods: Simulations were based on an exposome including 237 exposures with a realistic correlation structure. We considered several statistical regression-based methods, including two-step Environment-Wide Association Study (EWAS2), the Deletion/Substitution/Addition (DSA) algorithm, the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Group-Lasso INTERaction-NET (GLINTERNET), a three-step method based on regression trees and finally Boosted Regression Trees (BRT). We assessed the performance of each method in terms of model size, predictive ability, sensitivity and false discovery rate.
Results: GLINTERNET and DSA had better overall performance than the other methods, with GLINTERNET having better properties in terms of selecting the true predictors (sensitivity) and of predictive ability, while DSA had a lower number of false positives. In terms of ability to capture interaction terms, GLINTERNET and DSA had again the best performances, with the same trade-off between sensitivity and false discovery proportion. When GLINTERNET and DSA failed to select an exposure truly associated with the outcome, they tended to select a highly correlated one. When interactions were not present in the data, using variable selection methods that allowed for interactions had only slight costs in performance compared to methods that only searched for main effects.
Conclusions: GLINTERNET and DSA provided better performance in detecting two-way interactions, compared to other existing methods.},

	abstract = {Background: Estimating the health effects of multi-pollutant mixtures is of increasing interest in environmental epidemiology. Recently, a new approach for estimating the health effects of mixtures, Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), has been developed. This method estimates the multivariable exposure-response function in a flexible and parsimonious way, conducts variable selection on the (potentially high-dimensional) vector of exposures, and allows for a grouped variable selection approach that can accommodate highly correlated exposures. However, the application of this novel method has been limited by a lack of available software, the need to derive interpretable output in a computationally efficient manner, and the inability to apply the method to non-continuous outcome variables.
Methods: This paper addresses these limitations by (i) introducing an open-source software package in the R programming language, the bkmr R package, (ii) demonstrating methods for visualizing high-dimensional exposure-response functions, and for estimating scientifically relevant summaries, (iii) illustrating a probit regression implementation of BKMR for binary outcomes, and (iv) describing a fast version of BKMR that utilizes a Gaussian predictive process approach. All of the methods are illustrated using fully reproducible examples with the provided R code.
Results: Applying the methods to a continuous outcome example illustrated the ability of the BKMR implementation to estimate the health effects of multi-pollutant mixtures in the context of a highly nonlinear, biologically-based doseresponse function, and to estimate overall, single-exposure, and interactive health effects. The Gaussian predictive process method led to a substantial reduction in the runtime, without a major decrease in accuracy. In the setting of a larger number of exposures and a dichotomous outcome, the probit BKMR implementation was able to correctly identify the variables included in the exposure-response function and yielded interpretable quantities on the scale of a latent continuous outcome or on the scale of the outcome probability.
Conclusions: This newly developed software, integrated suite of tools, and extended methodology makes BKMR accessible for use across a broad range of epidemiological applications in which multiple risk factors have complex effects on health.},

	abstract = {Background: Numerous methods exist to analyze complex environmental mixtures in health studies. As an illustration of the different uses of mixture methods, we employed methods geared toward distinct research questions concerning persistent organic chemicals (POPs) as a mixture and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) as an outcome.
Methods: With information on 18 POPs and LTL among 1,003 U.S. adults (NHANES, 2001–2002), we used unsupervised methods including clustering to identify profiles of similarly exposed participants, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to identify common exposure patterns. We also employed supervised learning techniques, including penalized , weighted quantile sum (WQS), and Bayesian kernel machine (BKMR) regressions, to identify potentially toxic agents, and characterize nonlinear associations, interactions, and the overall mixture effect.
Results: Clustering separated participants into high, medium, and low POP exposure groups; longer log-LTL was found among those with high exposure. The first PCA component represented overall POP exposure and was positively associated with log-LTL. Two EFA factors, one representing furans and the other PCBs 126 and 118, were positively associated with log-LTL. Penalized regression methods selected three congeners in common (PCB 126, PCB 118, and furan 2,3,4,7,8-pncdf) as potentially toxic agents. WQS found a positive overall effect of the POP mixture and identified six POPs as potentially toxic agents (furans 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-hxcdf, 2,3,4,7,8-pncdf, and 1,2,3,6,7,8-hxcdf, and PCBs 99, 126, 169). BKMR found a positive linear association with furan 2,3,4,7,8-pncdf, suggestive evidence of linear associations with PCBs 126 and 169, and a positive overall effect of the mixture, but no interactions among congeners.
Conclusions: Using different methods, we identified patterns of POP exposure, potentially toxic agents, the absence of interaction, and estimated the overall mixture effect. These applications and results may serve as a guide for mixture method selection based on specific research questions.},

	abstract = {Humans are exposed to a diverse mixture of chemical and non-chemical exposures across their lifetimes. Well-designed epidemiology studies as well as sophisticated exposure science and related technologies enable the investigation of the health impacts of mixtures. While existing statistical methods can address the most basic questions related to the association between environmental mixtures and health endpoints, there were gaps in our ability to learn from mixtures data in several common epidemiologic scenarios, including high correlation among health and exposure measures in space and/or time, the presence of missing observations, the violation of important modeling assumptions, and the presence of computational challenges incurred by current implementations. To address these and other challenges, NIEHS initiated the Powering Research through Innovative methods for Mixtures in Epidemiology (PRIME) program, to support work on the development and expansion of statistical methods for mixtures. Six independent projects supported by PRIME have been highly productive but their methods have not yet been described collectively in a way that would inform application. We review 37 new methods from PRIME projects and summarize the work across previously published research questions, to inform methods selection and increase awareness of these new methods. We highlight important statistical advancements considering data science strategies, exposure-response estimation, timing of exposures, epidemiological methods, the incorporation of toxicity/chemical information, spatiotemporal data, risk assessment, and model performance, efficiency, and interpretation. Importantly, we link to software to encourage application and testing on other datasets. This review can enable more informed analyses of environmental mixtures. We stress training for early career scientists as well as innovation in statistical methodology as an ongoing need. Ultimately, we direct efforts to the common goal of reducing harmful exposures to improve public health.},

	abstract = {Background:
Exposure mixtures frequently occur in data across many domains, particularly in the fields of environmental and nutritional epidemiology. Various strategies have arisen to answer questions about exposure mixtures, including methods such as weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression that estimate a joint effect of the mixture components.

Objectives:
We demonstrate a new approach to estimating the joint effects of a mixture: quantile g-computation. This approach combines the inferential simplicity of WQS regression with the flexibility of g-computation, a method of causal effect estimation. We use simulations to examine whether quantile g-computation and WQS regression can accurately and precisely estimate the effects of mixtures in a variety of common scenarios.

Methods:
We examine the bias, confidence interval (CI) coverage, and bias–variance tradeoff of quantile g-computation and WQS regression and how these quantities are impacted by the presence of noncausal exposures, exposure correlation, unmeasured confounding, and nonlinearity of exposure effects.

Results:
Quantile g-computation, unlike WQS regression, allows inference on mixture effects that is unbiased with appropriate CI coverage at sample sizes typically encountered in epidemiologic studies and when the assumptions of WQS regression are not met. Further, WQS regression can magnify bias from unmeasured confounding that might occur if important components of the mixture are omitted from the analysis.

Discussion:
Unlike inferential approaches that examine the effects of individual exposures while holding other exposures constant, methods like quantile g-computation that can estimate the effect of a mixture are essential for understanding the effects of potential public health actions that act on exposure sources. Our approach may serve to help bridge gaps between epidemiologic analysis and interventions such as regulations on industrial emissions or mining processes, dietary changes, or consumer behavioral changes that act on multiple exposures simultaneously. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5838},

In most scenarios, BKMR, BSTARSS, GAMDP, and GAMTS achieved moderate to high sensitivity (0.52‐0.98) and specificity (0.21‐0.99). BART and MARS achieved high specificity (≥0.90), but low sensitivity in low signal‐to‐noise ratio scenarios (0.20‐0.51). Lasso was highly sensitive (0.71‐0.99), except for quadratic relationships (≤0.27). Penalized regression methods that assume linearity, such as lasso, may not be suitable for studies of environmental chemicals hypothesized to have nonmonotonic relationships with outcomes. Instead, BKMR, BSTARSS, GAMDP, and GAMTS are attractive methods for flexibly estimating the shapes of exposure‐response relationships and selecting among correlated exposures.},

We evaluated the performance of statistical methods for identifying exposure–outcome associations across various data structures typical of environmental and occupational epidemiology analyses.
Methods  We simulated a case–control study, generating 100 data sets for each of 270 different simulation scenarios; varying the number of exposure variables, the correlation between exposures, sample size, the number of effective exposures and the magnitude of effect estimates. We compared conventional analytical approaches, that is, univariable (with and without multiplicity adjustment), multivariable and stepwise logistic regression, with variable selection methods: sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis, boosting, and frequentist and Bayesian penalised regression approaches.
Results The variable selection methods consistently yielded more precise effect estimates and generally improved selection accuracy compared with conventional logistic regression methods, especially for scenarios with higher correlation levels. Penalised lasso and elastic net regression both seemed to perform particularly well, specifically when statistical inference based on a balanced weighting of high sensitivity and a low proportion of false discoveries is sought.
Conclusions In this extensive simulation study with multicollinear data, we found that most variable selection methods consistently outperformed conventional approaches, and demonstrated how performance is influenced by the structure of the data and underlying model.},

Despite these patterns, few studies have effectively considered structural inequalities as drivers of ecological and evolutionary outcomes and have instead focused on indicator variables such as neighborhood wealth. In this analysis, we explicitly integrate ecology, evolution, and social processes to emphasize the relationships that bind social inequities—specifically racism—and biological change in urbanized landscapes. We draw on existing research to link racist practices, including residential segregation, to the heterogeneous patterns of flora and fauna observed by urban ecologists. In the future, urban ecology and evolution researchers must consider how systems of racial oppression affect the environmental factors that drive biological change in cities. Conceptual integration of the social and ecological sciences has amassed considerable scholarship in urban ecology over the past few decades, providing a solid foundation for incorporating environmental justice scholarship into urban ecological and evolutionary research. Such an undertaking is necessary to deconstruct urbanization’s biophysical patterns and processes, inform equitable and anti-racist initiatives promoting justice in urban conservation, and strengthen community resilience to global environmental change.},

	abstract = {Evidence of combined mortality eﬀects of multi-pollutant on cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and the corresponding exposure-response (ER) relationship is limited. In this paper, we examined the association between four ambient air pollutants (i.e., ﬁne particulate matter, PM2.5, particulate matter, PM10, nitrogen dioxide, NO2, and sulfur dioxide, SO2.) and CVD mortality and the corresponding ER relationship after incorporating the potential interaction among the multiple pollutants. Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) was used to evaluate the ER relationship and to explore the interactions between pollutants. The results showed that PM10 and SO2 were dominant pollutants from 0 to 2 days, while PM2.5 and NO2 had strong eﬀect on CVD mortality from 3 to 4 days. Generally, PM2.5 and NO2 had the similar ER relationship across diﬀerent moving average concerning the CVD mortality. For the interaction among the multiple pollutants, we found that there is no interaction between particle pollutants (i.e. PM2.5 and PM10) and gaseous pollutants (i.e.NO2 and SO2). On the contrary, there might be an interaction between PM2.5 and PM10 though this interaction was detected by visually comparing the slopes of ER curves of a given particle pollutant at diﬀerent levels of the other particle pollutant. But there is a lack of statistical signiﬁcance test for this interaction. This study suggests that diﬀerent ambient air pollutants might have the dominant eﬀect on CVD deaths during diﬀerent moving average, though there might not be statistical signiﬁcant interactions among the ambient air pollutants in present study.},

Previous epidemiological studies on environmental risk factors mainly analyzed the impact of single pollutant exposure on health, while in fact, humans are constantly exposed to a complex mixture consisted of multiple pollutants/chemicals. In recent years, environmental epidemiologists have sought to assess adverse health effects of exposure to multi-pollutant mixtures based on the diversity of real-world environmental pollutants. However, the statistical challenges are considerable, for instance, multicollinearity and interaction among components of the mixture complicate the statistical analysis. There is currently no consensus on appropriate statistical methods. Here we summarized the practical statistical methods used in environmental epidemiology to estimate health effects of exposure to multipollutant mixture, such as Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), weighted quantile sum (WQS) re­ gressions, shrinkage methods (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, elastic network model, adaptive elastic-net model, and principal component analysis), environment-wide association study (EWAS), etc. We sought to review these statistical methods and determine the application conditions, strengths, weaknesses, and result interpretability of each method, providing crucial insight and assistance for addressing epidemiological statistical issues regarding health effects from multi-pollutant mixture.},

	abstract = {Background:
Trace metal concentrations may affect cardio-metabolic risk, but the role of prenatal exposure is unclear. We examined: 1) the relationship between blood metal concentrations during pregnancy and child cardio-metabolic risk factors; 2) overall effects of metals mixture (essential vs. nonessential); and 3) interactions between metals.

Methods:
We measured 11 metals in maternal 2nd trimester whole blood in a prospective birth cohort in Mexico City. In children 4–6 years old, we measured body mass index (BMI), percent body fat, and blood pressure (N=609); and plasma hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) , non-high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, leptin, and adiponectin (N=411). We constructed cardio-metabolic component scores using age- and sex-adjusted z-scores and averaged five scores to create a global risk score. We estimated linear associations of each metal with individual z-scores and used Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression to assess metal mixtures and interactions.

Results:
Higher total metals were associated with lower HbA1c, leptin, and systolic blood pressure, and with higher adiponectin and non-HDL cholesterol. We observed no interactions between metals. Higher selenium was associated with lower triglycerides in linear (β=−1.01 z-score units per 1 unit ln(Se), 95\%CI = −1.84; −0.18) and Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression models. Manganese was associated with decreased HbA1c in linear models (β = −0.32 and 95\% CI: −0.61, −0.03). Antimony and arsenic were associated with lower leptin in Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression models. Essential metals were more strongly associated with cardio-metabolic risk than were nonessential metals.

Conclusions:
Low essential metals during pregnancy were associated with increased cardio-metabolic risk factors in childhood.},

	abstract = {Most research on the effects of chemicals on biologic systems is conducted on one chemical at a time. However, in the real world people are exposed to mixtures, not single chemicals. Although various substances may have totally independent actions, in many cases two substances may act at the same site in ways that can be either additive or nonadditive. Many even more complex interactions may occur if two chemicals act at different but related targets. In the extreme case there may be synergistic effects, in which case the effects of two substances together are greater than the sum of either effect alone. In reality, most persons are exposed to many chemicals, not just one or two, and therefore the effects of a chemical mixture are extremely complex and may differ for each mixture depending on the chemical composition. This complexity is a major reason why mixtures have not been well studied. In this review we attempt to illustrate some of the principles and approaches that can be used to study effects of mixtures. By the nature of the state of the science, this discussion is more a presentation of what we do not know than of what we do know about mixtures. We approach the study of mixtures at three levels, using specific examples. First, we discuss several human diseases in relation to a variety of environmental agents believed to influence the development and progression of the disease. We present results of selected cellular and animal studies in which simple mixtures have been investigated. Finally, we discuss some of the effects of mixtures at a molecular level.},

New approach methodologies can support the filling of knowledge gaps on the toxicity and mode(s) of action of individual chemicals. (Bio)Monitoring, modeling, and better data sharing will support the derivation of more realistic co-exposure scenarios. As knowledge and data gaps often hamper an in-depth assessment of specific chemical mixtures, the option of taking account of possible mixture effects in single substance risk assessments is briefly discussed. To allow risk managers to take informed decisions, transparent documentation of assumptions and related uncertainties is recommended indicating the potential impact on the assessment. Considering the large number of possible combinations of chemicals in mixtures, prioritization is needed, so that actions first address mixtures of highest concern and chemicals that drive the mixture risk. As chemicals with different applications and regulated separately might lead to similar toxicological effects, it is important to consider chemical mixtures across legislative sectors.},

	title = {Part 1. {Statistical} {Learning} {Methods} for the {Effects} of {Multiple} {Air} {Pollution} {Constituents}},
	issn = {1041-5505},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA*) currently regulates individual air pollutants on a pollutant-by-pollutant basis, adjusted for other pollutants and potential confounders. However, the National Academies of Science concluded that a multipollutant regulatory approach that takes into account the joint effects of multiple constituents is likely to be more protective of human health. Unfortunately, the large majority of existing research had focused on health effects of air pollution for one pollutant or for one pollutant with control for the independent effects of a small number of copollutants. Limitations in existing statistical methods are at least partially responsible for this lack of information on joint effects. The goal of this project was to fill this gap by developing flexible statistical methods to estimate the joint effects of multiple pollutants, while allowing for potential nonlinear or nonadditive associations between a given pollutant and the health outcome of interest.
METHODS: We proposed Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) methods as a way to simultaneously achieve the multifaceted goals of variable selection, flexible estimation of the exposure-response relationship, and inference on the strength of the association between individual pollutants and health outcomes in a health effects analysis of mixtures. We first developed a BKMR variable-selection approach, which we call component-wise variable selection, to make estimating such a potentially complex exposure-response function possible by effectively using two types of penalization (or regularization) of the multivariate exposure-response surface. Next we developed an extension of this first variable-selection approach that incorporates knowledge about how pollutants might group together, such as multiple constituents of particulate matter that might represent a common pollution source category. This second grouped, or hierarchical, variable-selection procedure is applicable when groups of highly correlated pollutants are being studied. To investigate the properties of the proposed methods, we conducted three simulation studies designed to evaluate the ability of BKMR to estimate environmental mixtures responsible for health effects under potentially complex but plausible exposure-response relationships. An attractive feature of our simulation studies is that we used actual exposure data rather than simulated values. This real-data simulation approach allowed us to evaluate the performance of BKMR and several other models under realistic joint distributions of multipollutant exposure. The simulation studies compared the two proposed variable-selection approaches (component-wise and hierarchical variable selection) with each other and with existing frequentist treatments of kernel machine regression (KMR). After the simulation studies, we applied the newly developed methods to an epidemiologic data set and to a toxicologic data set. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed methods to human epidemiologic data, we estimated associations between short-term exposures to fine particulate matter constituents and blood pressure in the Maintenance of Balance, Independent Living, Intellect, and Zest in the Elderly (MOBILIZE) Boston study, a prospective cohort study of elderly subjects. To illustrate the applicability of these methods to animal toxicologic studies, we analyzed data on the associations between both blood pressure and heart rate in canines exposed to a composition of concentrated ambient particles (CAPs) in a study conducted at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health (the Harvard Chan School; formerly Harvard School of Public Health; Bartoli et al. 2009).
RESULTS: We successfully developed the theory and computational tools required to apply the proposed methods to the motivating data sets. Collectively, the three simulation studies showed that component-wise variable selection can identify important pollutants within a mixture as long as the correlations among pollutant concentrations are low to moderate. The hierarchical variable-selection method was more effective in high-dimension, high-correlation settings. Variable selection in existing frequentist KMR models can incur inflated type I error rates, particularly when pollutants are highly correlated. The analyses of the MOBILIZE data yielded evidence of a linear and additive association of black carbon (BC) or Cu exposure with standing diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and a linear association of S exposure with standing systolic blood pressure (SBP). Cu is thought to be a marker of urban road dust associated with traffic; and S is a marker of power plant emissions or regional long-range transported air pollution or both. Therefore, these analyses of the MOBILIZE data set suggest that emissions from these three source categories were most strongly associated with hemodynamic responses in this cohort. In contrast, in the Harvard Chan School canine study, after controlling for an overall effect of CAPs exposure, we did not observe any associations between DBP or SBP and any elemental concentrations. Instead, we observed strong evidence of an association between Mn concentrations and heart rate in that heart rate increased linearly with increasing concentrations of Mn. According to the positive matrix factorization (PMF) source apportionment analyses of the multipollutant data set from the Harvard Chan School Boston Supersite, Mn loads on the two factors that represent the mobile and road dust source categories. The results of the BKMR analyses in both the MOBILIZE and canine studies were similar to those from existing linear mixed model analyses of the same multipollutant data because the effects have linear and additive forms that could also have been detected using standard methods.
CONCLUSIONS: This work provides several contributions to the KMR literature. First, to our knowledge this is the first time KMR methods have been used to estimate the health effects of multipollutant mixtures. Second, we developed a novel hierarchical variable-selection approach within BKMR that is able to account for the structure of the mixture and systematically handle highly correlated exposures. The analyses of the epidemiologic and toxicologic data on associations between fine particulate matter constituents and blood pressure or heart rate demonstrated associations with constituents that are typically associated with traffic emissions, power plants, and long-range transported pollutants. The simulation studies showed that the BKMR methods proposed here work well for small to moderate data sets; more work is needed to develop computationally fast methods for large data sets. This will be a goal of future work.},

In this article, we summarize some of the unique challenges in exposure assessment, statistical methods, and methodology that epidemiologists face in addressing chemical mixtures. We propose three broad questions that epidemiological studies can address: a) What are the potential health impacts of individual chemical agents? b) What is the interaction among agents? And c) what are the health effects of cumulative exposure to multiple agents? As the field of mixtures research grows, we can use these three questions as a basis for defining our research questions and for developing methods that will help us better understand the effect of chemical exposures on human disease and well-being.},

	abstract = {Organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) are widely used pesticides, and previous studies showed that OPPs can increase the risk of central nervous system disorders (e.g., Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease). However, few studies have comprehensively explored their association with depression in general adults. We analyzed data from 5206 participants aged 20 years or more based on four National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cycles. OPPs exposure was estimated using measures of urinary concentrations for six OPPs metabolites. Survey-weighted generalized linear regression model (SWGLM) was used to explore the association of OPPs metabolites with depression. Subgroup analyses were performed by age (≦60 years and {\textgreater}60 years) and gender. The weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression model was used to explore the overall association of six OPPs metabolites with depression. In addition, The Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) model was applied to investigate the interaction and joint effects of multiple OPPs metabolites with depression. The SWGLM showed that dimethyl phosphate (DMP) and dimethyl thiophosphate (DMTP), whether taken as continuous or quartile variables, had a positive correlation with depression. Diethyl phosphate (DEP) and dimethyl dithiophosphate (DMDTP) in the highest quartile were positively associated with depression compared to the lowest quartile. In subgroup analysis, we found that the effects of the above chemicals on depression existed in the male and young middle-aged population, while DMP was present in the female. There was a significant combined overall effect of six OPPs metabolites with depression [OR = 1.232, 95\%CI: (1.011, 1.504)] in WQS. Furthermore, the BKMR model also showed a positive trend in the overall effect of six OPPs metabolites with depression. In conclusion, our results suggest that exposure to OPPs may increase the risk of depression in US adults. Men and young and middle-aged populations are more vulnerable to OPPs and the mixture of OPPs metabolites may induce depression.},

	abstract = {Lead (Pb) is a worldwide environmental contaminant that even at low levels influences brain development and affects neurobehavior later in life; nevertheless it is only a small fraction of the neurotoxicant (NT) exposome. Exposure to environmental Pb concurrent with other NT substances is often the norm, but their joint effects are challenging to study during early life. The aim of this review is to integrate studies of Pb-containing NT mixtures during the early life and neurodevelopment outcomes of children. The Pb-containing NT mixtures that have been most studied involve other metals (Mn, Al, Hg, Cd), metalloids (As), halogen (F), and organo-halogen pollutants. Co-occurring Pb-associated exposures during pregnancy and lactation depend on the environmental sources and the metabolism and half-life of the specific NT contaminant; but offspring neurobehavioral outcomes are also influenced by social stressors. Nevertheless, Pb-associated effects from prenatal exposure portend a continued burden on measurable neurodevelopment; they thus favor increased neurological health issues, decrements in neurobehavioral tests and reductions in the quality of life. Neurobehavioral test outcomes measured in the first 1000 days showed Pb-associated negative outcomes were frequently noticed in infants ({\textless}6 months). In older (preschool and school) children studies showed more variations in NT mixtures, children's age, and sensitivity and/or specificity of neurobehavioral tests; these variations and choice of statistical model (individual NT stressor or collective effect of mixture) may explain inconsistencies. Multiple exposures to NT mixtures in children diagnosed with ‘autism spectrum disorders’ (ASD) and ‘attention deficit and hyperactivity disorders’ (ADHD), strongly suggest a Pb-associated effect. Mixture potency (number or associated NT components and respective concentrations) and time (duration and developmental stage) of exposure often showed a measurable impact on neurodevelopment; however, net effects, reversibility and/or predictability of delays are insufficiently studied and need urgent attention. Nevertheless, neurodevelopment delays can be prevented and/or attenuated if public health policies are implemented to protect the unborn and the young child.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to chemical mixtures is recognized as the real-life scenario in all populations, needing new statistical methods that can assess their complex eﬀects.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the joint eﬀect of in utero exposure to arsenic, manganese, and lead on children’s neurodevelopment.
METHODS: We employed a novel statistical approach, Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), to study the joint eﬀect of coexposure to arsenic, manganese, and lead on neurodevelopment using an adapted Bayley Scale of Infant and Toddler Development™. Third Edition, in 825 mother–child pairs recruited into a prospective birth cohort from two clinics in the Pabna and Sirajdikhan districts of Bangladesh. Metals were measured in cord blood using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: Analyses were stratiﬁed by clinic due to diﬀerences in exposure proﬁles. In the Pabna district, which displayed high manganese levels [interquartile range (IQR): 4:8, 18 lg=dl], we found a statistically signiﬁcant negative eﬀect of the mixture of arsenic, lead, and manganese on cognitive score when cord blood metals concentrations were all above the 60th percentile (As   0:7 lg=dl, Mn   6:6 lg=dl, Pb   4:2 lg=dl) compared to the median (As = 0:5 lg=dl, Mn = 5:8 lg=dl, Pb = 3:1 lg=dl). Evidence of a nonlinear eﬀect of manganese was found. A change in log manganese from the 25th to the 75th percentile when arsenic and manganese were at the median was associated with a decrease in cognitive score of − 0:3 ( − 0:5, − 0:1) standard deviations. Our study suggests that arsenic might be a potentiator of manganese toxicity.
CONCLUSIONS: Employing a novel statistical method for the study of the health eﬀects of chemical mixtures, we found evidence of neurotoxicity of the mixture, as well as potential synergism between arsenic and manganese. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP614},

Studies have shown that exposures to these metals produce severe adverse effects. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects, particularly joint toxicities, are poorly understood in humans. The objective of this investigation was to identify and characterize prevalent combinations of these metals and their species in the U.S. NHANES population to provide background data for future studies of potential metal interactions. Exposure was defined as urine or blood levels ≥ medians of the NHANES 2007–2012 participants ≥6 years (n = 7408). Adjusted-odds ratios (adj-OR) and 95\% confidence intervals were determined for covariates (age, gender, and race/ethnicity, cotinine and body mass index). Speciesspecific analysis was also conducted for As and Hg including iAs (urinary arsenous acid and/or arsenic acid), met-iAs (urinary monomethylarsonic acid and/or dimethylarsinic acid), and oHg (blood methylmercury and/or ethyl-mercury). For combinations of As and Hg species, age- and gender-specific prevalence was determined among NHANES 2011–2012 participants (n = 2342). Data showed that approximately 49.3\% of the population contained a combination of three or more metals. The most prevalent unique specific combinations were Pb/Cd/Hg/As, Pb/Cd/Hg, and Pb/Cd. Age was consistently associated with these combinations: adj-ORs ranged from 10.9 (Pb/Cd) to 11.2 (Pb/Cd/Hg/As). Race/ ethnicity was significant for Pb/Cd/Hg/As. Among women of reproductive age, frequency of oHg/iAs/ met-iAS and oHg/met-iAs was 22.9 and 40.3\%, respectively. These findings may help prioritize efforts to assess joint toxicities and their impact on public health.},

Quantifying the impact of exposure to environmental chemical mixtures is important for identifying risk factors for diseases and developing more targeted public health interventions. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) held a workshop in July 2015 to address the need to develop novel statistical approaches for multi-pollutant epidemiology studies. The primary objective of the workshop was to identify and compare different statistical approaches and methods for analyzing complex chemical mixtures data in both simulated and real-world data sets. At the workshop, participants compared approaches and results and speculated as to why they may have differed. Several themes emerged: a) no one statistical approach appeared to outperform the others, b) many methods included some form of variable reduction or summation of the data before statistical analysis, c) the statistical approach should be selected based upon a specific hypothesis or scientific question, and d) related mixtures data should be shared among researchers to more comprehensively and accurately address methodological questions and statistical approaches. Future efforts should continue to design and optimize statistical approaches to address questions about chemical mixtures in epidemiological studies.},

	abstract = {An important goal of environmental health research is to assess the risk posed by mixtures of environmental exposures. Two popular classes of models for mixtures analyses are response-surface methods and exposure-index methods. Response-surface methods estimate high-dimensional surfaces and are thus highly flexible but difficult to interpret. In contrast, exposure-index methods decompose coefficients from a linear model into an overall mixture effect and individual index weights; these models yield easily interpretable effect estimates and efficient inferences when model assumptions hold, but, like most parsimonious models, incur bias when these assumptions do not hold. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian multiple index model framework that combines the strengths of each, allowing for non-linear and non-additive relationships between exposure indices and a health outcome, while reducing the dimensionality of the exposure vector and estimating index weights with variable selection. This framework contains response-surface and exposure-index models as special cases, thereby unifying the two analysis strategies. This unification increases the range of models possible for analysing environmental mixtures and health, allowing one to select an appropriate analysis from a spectrum of models varying in flexibility and interpretability. In an analysis of the association between telomere length and 18 organic pollutants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the proposed approach fits the data as well as more complex response-surface methods and yields more interpretable results.},

Reduced fetal growth increases the risk for adverse health outcomes. Growing evidence suggests that metal exposures contribute to reduced fetal growth, but little is known about the effects of complex metal mixtures.

Objectives:
We investigated the impact of a complex mixture of metals on birth weight for gestational age (BW for GA) in the Maternal and Developmental Risks from Environmental and Social Stressors study, a predominately lower-income Hispanic pregnancy cohort in Los Angeles, California.

Methods:
Cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), mercury (Hg), nickel (Ni), molybdenum (Mo), lead (Pb), antimony (Sb), tin (Sn), and thallium (Tl) were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in maternal urine samples collected in early pregnancy (median GA: 13.1 wk).

Results:
In primary analyses, Hg and Ni ranked highest as predictors of BW for GA. An inverse linear association was estimated for Hg, whereas a positive association was estimated for Ni at low-to-moderate concentrations. A potential interaction between Hg and Ni was also identified. In our exploratory analysis, Sb ranked highest as a predictor of BW for GA, followed by Hg and Ni.

Conclusions:
Our findings suggest that in this understudied population, Hg may reduce fetal growth, whereas Ni may promote fetal growth. We also identified Sb as a potential metal of concern for this population, which merits additional investigation. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7201},

The quantification of the effects of exposure to an environmental mixture poses several statistical challenges. It is often the case that exposure to multiple pollutants interact with each other to affect an outcome. Further, the exposure-response relationship between an outcome and some exposures, such as some metals, can exhibit complex, nonlinear forms, since some exposures can be beneficial and detrimental at different ranges of exposure. To estimate the health effects of complex mixtures, we propose a flexible Bayesian approach that allows exposures to interact with each other and have nonlinear relationships with the outcome. We induce sparsity using multivariate spike and slab priors to determine which exposures are associated with the outcome and which exposures interact with each other. The proposed approach is interpretable, as we can use the posterior probabilities of inclusion into the model to identify pollutants that interact with each other. We utilize our approach to study the impact of exposure to metals on child neurodevelopment in Bangladesh and find a nonlinear, interactive relationship between arsenic and manganese.},

	abstract = {Background:
Prenatal exposures to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during critical developmental windows have been implicated in the etiologies of a wide array of adverse perinatal and pediatric outcomes. Epidemiological studies have concentrated on the health effects of individual chemicals, despite the understanding that EDCs act together via common mechanisms, that pregnant women are exposed to multiple EDCs simultaneously, and that substantial toxicological evidence of adverse developmental effects has been documented. There is a move toward multipollutant models in environmental epidemiology; however, there is no current consensus on appropriate statistical methods.

Objectives:
We aimed to review the statistical methods used in these studies, to identify additional applicable methods, and to determine the strengths and weaknesses of each method for addressing the salient statistical and epidemiological challenges.

Methods:
We searched Embase, MEDLINE, and Web of Science for epidemiological studies of endocrine-sensitive outcomes in the children of mothers exposed to EDC mixtures during pregnancy and identified alternative statistical methods from the wider literature.

Discussion:
We identified 74 studies and analyzed the methods used to estimate mixture health effects, identify important mixture components, account for nonmonotonicity in exposure–response relationships, assess interactions, and identify windows of exposure susceptibility. We identified both frequentist and Bayesian methods that are robust to multicollinearity, performing shrinkage, variable selection, dimension reduction, statistical learning, or smoothing, including methods that were not used by the studies included in our review.

Conclusions:
Compelling motivation exists for analyzing EDCs as mixtures, yet many studies make simplifying assumptions about EDC additivity, relative potency, and linearity, or overlook the potential for bias due to asymmetries in chemical persistence. We discuss the potential impacts of these choices and suggest alternative methods to improve analyses of prenatal exposure to EDC mixtures. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2207},

	abstract = {The use of high-dimensional data has expanded in many fields, including in clinical research, thus making variable selection methods increasingly important compared to traditional statistical approaches. The work aims to compare the performance of three supervised Bayesian variable selection methods to detect the most important predictors among a high-dimensional set of variables and to provide useful and practical guidelines of their use. We assessed the variable selection ability of: (1) Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR), (2) Bayesian Semiparametric Regression (BSR), and (3) Bayesian Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (BLASSO) regression on simulated data of different dimensions and under three scenarios with disparate predictor-response relationships and correlations among predictors. This is the first study describing when one model should be preferred over the others and when methods achieve comparable results. BKMR outperformed all other models with small synthetic datasets. BSR was strongly dependent on the choice of its own intrinsic parameter, but its performance was comparable to BKMR with large datasets. BLASSO should be preferred only when it is reasonable to hypothesise the absence of synergies between predictors and the presence of monotonous predictor-outcome relationships. Finally, we applied the models to a real case study and assessed the relationships among anthropometric, biochemical, metabolic, cardiovascular, and inflammatory variables with weight loss in 755 hospitalised obese women from the Follow Up OBese patients at AUXOlogico institute (FUOBAUXO) cohort.},

	abstract = {A growing body of literature suggests that higher developmental exposure to individual or mixtures of environmental chemicals (ECs) is associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the effect of interactions among these ECs is challenging to study. We introduced a composition of the classical exposure-mixture Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression, and a machine-learning method called signed iterative random forest (SiRF) to discover synergistic interactions between ECs that are (1) associated with higher odds of ASD diagnosis, (2) mimic toxicological interactions, and (3) are present only in a subset of the sample whose chemical concentrations are higher than certain thresholds. In the case-control Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and Environment study, we evaluated multi-ordered synergistic interactions among 62 ECs measured in the urine samples of 479 children in association with increased odds for ASD diagnosis (yes vs. no). WQS-SiRF discovered two synergistic two-ordered interactions between (1) trace-element cadmium(Cd) and alkyl-phosphate pesticide - diethyl-phosphate(DEP); and (2) 2,4,6-trichlorophenol(TCP-246) and DEP metabolites. Both interactions were suggestively associated with increased odds of ASD diagnosis in a subset of children with urinary concentrations of Cd, DEP, and TCP-246 above the 75th percentile. This study demonstrates a novel method that combines the inferential power of WQS and the predictive accuracy of machine-learning algorithms to discover interpretable EC interactions associated with ASD.
Synopsis The effect of interactions among environmental chemicals on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis is challenging to study. We used a combination of Weighted Quantile Sum regression and machine-learning tools to study multi-ordered synergistic interactions between environmental chemicals associated with higher odds of ASD diagnosis.

	abstract = {In many practical problems that simultaneously investigate the joint effect of covariates, we first need to identify the subset of significant covariates, and then estimate their joint effect. An example is an epidemiological study that analyzes the effects of exposure variables on a health response. In order to make inferences on the covariate effects, we propose a Bayesian additive nonparametric regression model with a multivariate continuous shrinkage prior to address the model uncertainty and to identify important covariates. Our general approach is to decompose the response function into the sum of the nonlinear main effects and the two-way interaction terms. Then we apply the computationally advantageous Bayesian variable selection method to identify the important effects. The proposed Bayesian method is a multivariate Dirichlet–Laplace prior that aggressively shrinks many terms toward zero, thus mitigating the noise of including unimportant exposures and isolating the effects of the important covariates. Our theoretical studies demonstrate asymptotic prediction and variable selection consistency properties. In addition, we use numerical simulations to evaluate the model performance in terms of prediction and variable selection under practical scenarios. The method is applied to a neurobehavioral data set from the Agricultural Health Study that investigates the association between pesticide usage and neurobehavioral outcomes in farmers. The proposed method shows improved accuracy in predicting the joint e ects on the neurobehavioral responses, while restricting the number of covariates included in the model through variable selection.},

	abstract = {Understanding the relationships between exposure and disease incidence is an important problem in environmental epidemiology. Typically, a large number of these exposures are measured, and it is found either that a few exposures transmit risk or that each exposure transmits a small amount of risk, but, taken together, these may pose a substantial disease risk. Further, these exposure effects can be nonlinear. We develop a latent functional approach, which assumes that the individual effect of each exposure can be characterized as one of a series of unobserved functions, where the number of latent functions is less than or equal to the number of exposures. We propose Bayesian methodology to fit models with a large number of exposures and show that existing Bayesian group LASSO approaches are a special case of the proposed model. An efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm is developed for carrying out Bayesian inference. The deviance information criterion is used to choose an appropriate number of nonlinear latent functions. We demonstrate the good properties of the approach using simulation studies. Further, we show that complex exposure relationships can be represented with only a few latent functional curves. The proposed methodology is illustrated with an analysis of the effect of cumulative pesticide exposure on cancer risk in a large cohort of farmers.},

Chemicals often co-occur in the environment or in synthetic mixtures and as a result exposure levels can be highly correlated.

By including a quadratic regression in the latent variables in the response component, we induce flexible dimension reduction in characterizing main effects and interactions. We propose a Bayesian approach to inference under this factor analysis for interactions (FIN) framework. Through appropriate modifications of the factor modeling structure, FIN can accommodate higher order interactions.

	abstract = {Exposure to environmental mixtures can exert wide-ranging effects on child neurodevelopment. However, there is a lack of statistical methods that can accommodate the complex exposure-response relationship between mixtures and neurodevelopment while simultaneously estimating neurodevelopmental trajectories. We introduce Bayesian varying coefficient kernel machine regression (BVCKMR), a hierarchical model that estimates how mixture exposures at a given time point are associated with health outcome trajectories. The BVCKMR flexibly captures the exposure-response relationship, incorporates prior knowledge, and accounts for potentially nonlinear and nonadditive effects of individual exposures. This model assesses the directionality and relative importance of a mixture component on health outcome trajectories and predicts health effects for unobserved exposure profiles. Using contour plots and cross-sectional plots, BVCKMR also provides information about interactions between complex mixture components. The BVCKMR is applied to a subset of data from PROGRESS, a prospective birth cohort study in Mexico city on exposure to metal mixtures and temporal changes in neurodevelopment. The mixture include metals such as manganese, arsenic, cobalt, chromium, cesium, copper, lead, cadmium, and antimony. Results from a subset of Programming Research in Obesity, Growth, Environment and Social Stressors data provide evidence of significant positive associations between second trimester exposure to copper and Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development cognition score at 24 months, and cognitive trajectories across 6-24 months. We also detect an interaction effect between second trimester copper and lead exposures for cognition at 24 months. In summary, BVCKMR provides a framework for estimating neurodevelopmental trajectories associated with exposure to complex mixtures.},

Research seeks to identify critical windows, time periods when exposures can change future health outcomes, and estimate the exposure–response relationship. Existing statistical approaches focus on estimation of the association between maternal exposure to a single environmental chemical observed at high temporal resolution (e.g., weekly throughout pregnancy) and children's health outcomes. Extending to multiple chemicals observed at high temporal resolution poses a dimensionality problem and statistical methods are lacking. We propose a regression tree–based model for mixtures of exposures observed at high temporal resolution. The proposed approach uses an additive ensemble of tree pairs that defines structured main effects and interactions between time-resolved predictors and performs variable selection to select out of the model predictors not correlated with the outcome. In simulation, we show that the tree-based approach performs better than existing methods for a single exposure and can accurately estimate critical windows in the exposure–response relation for mixtures. We apply our method to estimate the relationship between five exposures measured weekly throughout pregnancy and birth weight in a Denver, Colorado, birth cohort. We identified critical windows during which fine particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and temperature are negatively associated with birth weight and an interaction between fine particulate matter and temperature.

However, most epidemiologic studies have focused on understanding their additive effects, despite that individuals are exposed to multiple air pollutants simultaneously that are likely correlated with each other. Therefore, we applied a novel method - Bayesian Kernel machine regression (BKMR) and conducted a population-based cohort study to assess the individual and joint effect of air pollutant mixtures (PM2.5, O3, and NO2) on all-cause mortality among the Medicare population in 15 cities with 656 different ZIP codes in the southeastern US. The results suggest a strong association between pollutant mixture and all-cause mortality, mainly driven by PM2.5. The positive association of PM2.5 with mortality appears stronger at lower percentiles of other pollutants. An interquartile range change in PM2.5 concentration was associated with a significant increase in mortality of 1.7 (95\% CI: 0.5, 2.9), 1.6 (95\% CI: 0.4, 2.7) and 1.4 (95\% CI: 0.1, 2.6) standard deviations (SD) when O3 and NO2 were set at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, respectively. BKMR analysis did not identify statistically significant interactions among PM2.5, O3, and NO2. However, since the small sub-population might weaken the study power, additional studies (in larger sample size and other regions in the US) are in need to reinforce the current finding.},

	abstract = {Background: Pregnant women are regularly exposed to a multitude of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). EDC exposures, both individually and as mixtures, may affect fetal growth. The relationship of EDC mixtures with infant birth weight, however, remains poorly understood. We examined the relations between prenatal exposure to EDC mixtures and infant birth weight.
Methods: We used data from the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) Study, a panCanadian cohort of 1857 pregnant women enrolled between 2008 and 2011. We quantified twenty-one chem­ ical concentrations from five EDC classes, including organochlorine compounds (OCs), metals, perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), phenols and phthalate metabolites that were detected in {\textgreater}70\% of urine or blood samples collected during the first trimester. In our primary analysis, we used Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) models to assess variable importance, explore EDC mixture effects, and identify any interactions among EDCs. Our secondary analysis used traditional linear regression to compare the results with those of BKMR and to quantify the changes in mean birth weight in relation to prenatal EDC exposures.
Results: We found evidence that mixtures of OCs and metals were associated with monotonic decreases in mean birth weight across the whole range of exposure. trans-Nonachlor from the OC mixture and lead (Pb) from the metal mixture had the greatest impact on birth weight. Our linear regression analysis corroborated the BKMR results and found that a 2-fold increase in trans-nonachlor and Pb concentrations reduced mean birth weight by − 38 g (95\% confidence interval (CI): − 67, − 10) and − 39 g (95\% CI: − 69, − 9), respectively. A sex-specific association for OC mixture was observed among female infants. PFAS, phenols and phthalates were not asso­ ciated with birth weight. No interactions were observed among the EDCs.
Conclusions: Using BKMR, we observed that both OC and metal mixtures were associated with decreased birth weight in the MIREC Study. trans-Nonachlor from the OC mixture and Pb from the metal mixture contributed most to the adverse effects.},

	abstract = {Greater understanding of the pathways through which an environmental mixture operates is important to design effective interventions. We present new methodology to estimate natural direct and indirect effects and controlled direct effects of a complex mixture exposure on an outcome through a mediator variable. We implement Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) to allow for all possible interactions and nonlinear effects of (1) the co-exposures on the mediator, (2) the co-exposures and mediator on the outcome, and (3) selected covariates on the mediator and/or outcome. From the posterior predictive distributions of the mediator and outcome, we simulate counterfactuals to obtain posterior samples, estimates, and credible intervals of the mediation effects. Our simulation study demonstrates that when the exposure-mediator and exposure-mediator-outcome relationships are complex, BKMR-Causal Mediation Analysis performs better than current mediation methods. We applied our methodology to quantify the contribution of birth length as a mediator between in utero co-exposure to arsenic, manganese, and lead, and children's neurodevelopmental scores, in a prospective birth cohort in Bangladesh. Among younger children, we found a negative (adverse) association between the metal mixture and neurodevelopment. We also found evidence that birth length mediates the effect of exposure to the metal mixture on neurodevelopment for younger children. If birth length were fixed to its 75th percentile value, the harmful effect of the metal mixture on neurodevelopment is attenuated, suggesting nutritional interventions to help increase fetal growth, and thus birth length, could potentially block the harmful effect of the metal mixture on neurodevelopment.},

	abstract = {We consider a semiparametric regression model that relates a normal outcome to covariates and a genetic pathway, where the covariate effects are modeled parametrically and the pathway effect of multiple gene expressions is modeled parametrically or nonparametrically using least-squares kernel machines (LSKMs). This unified framework allows a flexible function for the joint effect of multiple genes within a pathway by specifying a kernel function and allows for the possibility that each gene expression effect might be nonlinear and the genes within the same pathway are likely to interact with each other in a complicated way. This semiparametric model also makes it possible to test for the overall genetic pathway effect. We show that the LSKM semiparametric regression can be formulated using a linear mixed model. Estimation and inference hence can proceed within the linear mixed model framework using standard mixed model software. Both the regression coefficients of the covariate effects and the LSKM estimator of the genetic pathway effect can be obtained using the best linear unbiased predictor in the corresponding linear mixed model formulation. The smoothing parameter and the kernel parameter can be estimated as variance components using restricted maximum likelihood. A score test is developed to test for the genetic pathway effect. Model/variable selection within the LSKM framework is discussed. The methods are illustrated using a prostate cancer data set and evaluated using simulations.},

In contrast, exposure-index methods decompose coefficients from a linear model into an overall mixture effect and individual index weights; these models yield easily interpretable effect estimates and efficient inferences when model assumptions hold, but, like most parsimonious models, incur bias when these assumptions do not hold. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian multiple index model framework that combines the strengths of each, allowing for non-linear and non-additive relationships between exposure indices and a health outcome, while reducing the dimensionality of the exposure vector and estimating index weights with variable selection. This framework contains response-surface and exposure-index models as special cases, thereby unifying the two analysis strategies. This unification increases the range of models possible for analysing environmental mixtures and health, allowing one to select an appropriate analysis from a spectrum of models varying in flexibility and interpretability. In an analysis of the association between telomere length and 18 organic pollutants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the proposed approach fits the data as well as more complex response-surface methods and yields more interpretable results.},

Participants were asked to interpret graphically displayed statistical interactions. In such problems, all independent variables need to be considered together, so that decomposition into smaller subtasks is constrained, and thus the order of the interaction directly determines conceptual complexity. As the order of the interaction increases, the number of variables increases. Results showed a significant decline in accuracy and speed of solution from three-way to four-way interactions. Furthermore, performance on a ﬁve-way interaction was at chance level. These ﬁndings suggest that a structure deﬁned on four variables is at the limit of human processing capacity.},

	abstract = {The exposome recognizes that individuals are exposed simultaneously to a multitude of different environmental factors and takes a holistic approach to the discovery of etiological factors for disease. However, challenges arise when trying to quantify the health effects of complex exposure mixtures. Analytical challenges include dealing with high dimensionality, studying the combined effects of these exposures and their interactions, integrating causal pathways, and integrating high-throughput omics layers. To tackle these challenges, the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) held a data challenge event open to researchers from all over the world and from all expertises. Analysts had a chance to compete and apply state-of-the-art methods on a common partially simulated exposome dataset (based on real case data from the HELIX project) with multiple correlated exposure variables (P {\textgreater} 100 exposure variables) arising from general and personal environments at different time points, biological molecular data (multi-omics: DNA methylation, gene expression, proteins, metabolomics) and multiple clinical phenotypes in 1301 mother–child pairs. Most of the methods presented included feature selection or feature reduction to deal with the high dimensionality of the exposome dataset. Several approaches explicitly searched for combined effects of exposures and/or their interactions using linear index models or response surface methods, including Bayesian methods. Other methods dealt with the multi-omics dataset in mediation analyses using multiple-step approaches. Here we discuss features of the statistical models used and provide the data and codes used, so that analysts have examples of implementation and can learn how to use these methods. Overall, the exposome data challenge presented a unique opportunity for researchers from different disciplines to create and share state-of-the-art analytical methods, setting a new standard for open science in the exposome and environmental health field.},

	abstract = {A major difference between infectious and non-communicable diseases is that infectious diseases typically have unique necessary causes whereas noncommunicable diseases have multiple causes which by themselves are usually neither necessary nor sufficient. Epidemiology seems to have reached a limit in disentangling the role of single components in causal complexes, particularly at low doses. To overcome limitations the discipline can take advantage of technical developments including the science of the exposome. By referring to the interpretation of the exposome as put forward in the work of Wild and Rappaport, I show examples of how the science of multi-causality can build upon the developments of omic technologies. Finally, I broaden the picture by advocating a more holistic approach to causality that also encompasses social sciences and the concept of embodiment. To tackle NCDs effectively on one side we can invest in various omic approaches, to identify new external causes of non-communicable diseases (that we can use to develop preventive strategies), and the corresponding mechanistic pathways. On the other side, we need to focus on the social and societal determinants which are suggested to be the root causes of many non-communicable diseases.},

	abstract = {Background
In the next 25years, transformative changes, in particular the rapid pace of technological development and data availability, will require environmental epidemiologists to prioritize what should (rather than could) be done to most effectively improve population health.
Objectives
In this essay, we map out key driving forces that will shape environmental epidemiology in the next 25years. We also identify how the field should adapt to best take advantage of coming opportunities and prepare for challenges.
Discussion
Future environmental epidemiologists will face a world shaped by longer lifespans but also larger burdens of chronic health conditions; shifting populations by region and into urban areas; and global environmental change. Rapidly evolving technologies, particularly in sensors and OMICs, will present opportunities for the field. How should it respond? We argue, the field best adapts to a changing world by focusing on healthy aging; evidence gaps, especially in susceptible populations and low-income countries; and by developing approaches to better handle complexity and more formalized analysis.
Conclusions
Environmental epidemiology informing disease prevention will continue to be valuable. However, the field must adapt to remain relevant. In particular, the field must ensure that public health importance drives research questions, while seizing the opportunities presented by new technologies. Environmental epidemiologists of the future will require different, refined skills to work effectively across disciplines, ask the right questions, and implement appropriate study designs in a data-rich world.},

	abstract = {The importance of the social environment and social inequalities in disease etiology is well-known due to the profound research and conceptual framework on social determinants of health. For a long period, in exposome research with its classical orientation towards detrimental health effects of biological, chemical, and physical exposures, this knowledge remained underrepresented. But currently it gains great awareness and calls for innovations in rethinking the role of social environmental health determinants. To fill this gap that exists in terms of the social domain within exposome research, we propose a novel conceptual framework of the Social Exposome, to integrate the social environment in conjunction with the physical environment into the exposome concept. The iterative development process of the Social Exposome was based on a systematic compilation of social exposures in order to achieve a holistic portrayal of the human social environment – including social, psychosocial, socioeconomic, sociodemographic, local, regional, and cultural aspects, at individual and contextual levels. In order to move the Social Exposome beyond a mere compilation of exposures, three core principles are emphasized that underly the interplay of the multitude of exposures: Multidimensionality, Reciprocity, and Timing and continuity. The key focus of the conceptual framework of the Social Exposome is on understanding the underlying mechanisms that translate social exposures into health outcomes. In particular, insights from research on health equity and environmental justice have been incorporated to uncover how social inequalities in health emerge, are maintained, and systematically drive health outcomes. Three transmission pathways are presented: Embodiment, Resilience and Susceptibility or Vulnerability, and Empowerment. The Social Exposome conceptual framework may serve as a strategic map for, both, research and intervention planning, aiming to further explore the impact of the complex social environment and to alter transmission pathways to minimize health risks and health inequalities and to foster equity in health.},

Meanwhile, risk factor epidemiology has been subject to intense debate, both within and outside the discipline. The following review offers an overview of critical intradisciplinary debates. It then opens discussion on three partially overlapping areas where social theory has been called upon to contribute to epidemiological inquiry, namely analysis of macro-social determinants of health and disease, of categories of human difference and of embodiment.

	abstract = {Risk has become a dominant way to interpret who gets sick and why. A distinction has been drawn between two categories of risk: those arising from the environment, and those resulting from an individual's lifestyle. We identify a third category that might be called corporeal or embodied risk which has received little scholarly attention. Embodied risks are so called because they are located in the body of the person said to be “at risk”. Environmental risks are due to something that happens to a person; lifestyle risks occur because of something a person does or does not do, while embodied risks say something about who the person is. To investigate how people experience health risks—especially risks identified as characteristics of their bodies—we conducted detailed interviews with 29 women who were told they had an abnormal Pap smear. All health risks pose problems for people who are diagnosed as “at risk”: They must translate probabilistic statements about populations into terms that have personal meaning; they must cope with uncertainty; they must consider what it means to be in danger of developing an illness even though most have no symptoms; and they must mobilise appropriate surveillance and perhaps risk reduction. However, limiting attention to environmental and lifestyle risk (and the distinction between them) neglects the additional challenges posed by corporeal risks: the simultaneous presence of disease now and the possibility of more consequential disease in the future; the necessity to submit to ongoing medical surveillance; a tendency to exacerbate the cartesian split between body and self; and the absence of medical or popular discourses through which to interpret and respond to embodied risk. We call upon medicine and public health practitioners to work together with people who are at risk to formulate languages and approaches that can reflect both scientific accuracy (as it is currently understood), and the needs of people to integrate health threats into their daily personal lives.},

We discuss interaction on both additive and multiplicative scales using risks, and we discuss their relation to statistical models (e.g. linear, log-linear, and logistic models). We discuss and evaluate arguments that have been made for using additive or multiplicative scales to assess interaction. We further discuss approaches to presenting interaction analyses, different mechanistic forms of interaction, when interaction is robust to unmeasured confounding, interaction for continuous outcomes, qualitative or “crossover” interactions, methods for attributing effects to interactions, case-only estimators of interaction, and power and sample size calculations for additive and multiplicative interaction.},

International Journal of Epidemiology 1981, 10: 383–387.From the assessment of statistical interaction between risk factors it is tempting to infer the nature of the biologic interaction between the factors. However, the use of statistical analyses of epidemiologic data to infer biologic processes can be misleading. As an example, we consider the multistage model of carcinogenesis. Under this biologic model, it is shown, by means of simple hypothetical examples, that even if carcinogenic factors act independently, some pairs may fit an additive statistical model, some a multiplicative statistical model, and some neither. The elucidation of biological interactions by means of statistical models requires the imaginative and prudent use of inductive and deductive reasoning; it cannot be done mechanically.},

	abstract = {Identifying the exposures or interventions that exacerbate or ameliorate racial health disparities is one of the fundamental goals of social epidemiology. Introducing an interaction term between race and an exposure into a statistical model is commonly used in the epidemiologic literature to assess racial health disparities and the potential viability of a targeted health intervention. However, researchers may attribute too much authority to the interaction term and inadvertently ignore other salient information regarding the health disparity. In this article, we highlight empirical examples from the literature demonstrating limitations of overreliance on interaction terms in health disparities research; we further suggest approaches for moving beyond interaction terms when assessing these disparities. We promote a comprehensive framework of three guiding questions for disparity investigation, suggesting examination of the group-specific differences in (1) outcome prevalence, (2) exposure prevalence, and (3) effect size. Our framework allows for better assessment of meaningful differences in population health and the resulting implications for interventions, demonstrating that interaction terms alone do not provide sufficient means for determining how disparities arise. The widespread adoption of this more comprehensive approach has the potential to dramatically enhance understanding of the patterning of health and disease and the drivers of health disparities.},

By tracing the contingent and uncertain relations that endow objects with seemingly stable boundaries, entanglement allows us to see how such boundaries restrict our ability to know the world better. This article examines the concept of entanglement in the context of contemporary life in a working-class Mexico City neighborhood, Colonia Periférico, and a longitudinal environmental health project that studies the neighborhood’s residents. While entanglement has its uses, the entanglement of working-class bodies with globalizing processes like NAFTA and the ongoing War on Drugs shows that the concept has its limits. For working-class residents, life is already deeply entangled with chronic economic and political instability shaped through the violent ravages of transnational capital. Instead, I trace how residents in Colonia Periférico secure stability through toxic boundaries that protectively keep out the disruptive effects of police and public health surveillance. Colonia Periférico’s boundaries, which include a sewage-filled dam, cement dust, and freeway exhaust, are clearly entangled with residents’ bodies. They get inside. These entanglements are the price paid for a remarkable stability, in which children can play on the streets and attentive care for drug-addicted and disabled residents is part of everyday life. With the goal of knowing the world better, then, we might complicate celebratory calls for the uncertainty of entanglement by taking into account both the practices that make boundaries and what boundaries have to offer.},

We will introduce Gaussian processes which generate distributions over functions used for Bayesian non-parametric regression, and demonstrate their use in applications and didactic examples including simple regression problems, a demonstration of kernel-encoded prior assumptions and compositions, a pure exploration scenario within an optimal design framework, and a bandit-like exploration–exploitation scenario where the goal is to recommend movies.

The novel entities boundary in the planetary boundaries framework refers to entities that are novel in a geological sense and that could have large-scale impacts that threaten the integrity of Earth system processes. We review the scientiﬁc literature relevant to quantifying the boundary for novel entities and highlight plastic pollution as a particular aspect of high concern. An impact pathway from production of novel entities to impacts on Earth system processes is presented. We deﬁne and apply three criteria for assessment of the suitability of control variables for the boundary: feasibility, relevance, and comprehensiveness. We propose several complementary control variables to capture the complexity of this boundary, while acknowledging major data limitations. We conclude that humanity is currently operating outside the planetary boundary based on the weight-of-evidence for several of these control variables. The increasing rate of production and releases of larger volumes and higher numbers of novel entities with diverse risk potentials exceed societies’ ability to conduct safety related assessments and monitoring. We recommend taking urgent action to reduce the harm associated with exceeding the boundary by reducing the production and releases of novel entities, noting that even so, the persistence of many novel entities and/or their associated eﬀects will continue to pose a threat.},

	abstract = {Mediation analysis offers an essential and rapidly expanding tool in environmental health studies to investigate the contribution of environmental factors towards observed associations between risk factors and health outcomes. When evaluating environmental factors, there may be particular interest in quantifying the impact of exposure to environmental mixtures on human health. In this context, evaluating the joint effect of multiple chemicals or pollutants, rather than individual examination, allows accurate identification of risk factors, assessment of interactions, and ultimately development of more targeted public health interventions. While mediation analysis has been extended to incorporate several methodological complexities specific to environmental factors, little attention has been given to integrating the analysis of environmental mixtures. The aim of this review is to present some of the available methods for environmental mixtures, and discuss how these methods can be integrated within a mediation analysis framework. By incorporating these methods into a mediation framework, investigators will be able to evaluate the contribution of environmental mixtures as mediators of exposure-outcome associations, based on methodologies that are currently available. While standard regression-based methods for multiple mediators can be used, these can easily become unstable as the number of mixture components increases. Summary and classification methods, or hierarchical modeling, can reduce the number of mediators by creating scores or possibly uncorrelated subgroups. This approach allows retrieving indirect effects due to the mixture or to a specific subgroup, but makes identification of component-specific effects and interactions complicated. Finally, one can use various approaches for analyzing mixtures in a two-stage fashion, selecting relevant mediators to be included in the final model. We focused this review on techniques that have been presented to the environmental health community and that can be conducted with major statistical software. We encourage researchers to move beyond the evaluation of one environmental factor at a time to the assessment of the joint effects of environmental mixtures when a mediation model is of interest. Available methods target different aspects related to environmental mixtures and the choice of the suitable approach will depend on data structures and the research question of interest.},

	abstract = {In the environment, organisms are exposed to a diverse array of chemicals in complex mixtures. The majority of approaches that aim to assess the risk of environmental chemical mixtures, including those used by regulatory bodies, use toxicity data generated from the individual component chemicals to predict the overall mixture toxicity. It is assumed that the behaviour of chemicals in a mixture can be predicted using the concepts of concentration or dose addition for chemicals with similar mechanisms of action or response addition for dissimilarly acting chemicals. Based on empirical evidence, most traditional risk assessment methods, such as toxic equivalency factors and the hazard index, make the assumption that the components of a mixture adhere to the concentration addition model. Thus, mixture toxicity can be predicted by the summation of the individual component toxicities. However in some mixtures, interactions can occur between chemicals or at target sites that alter the toxicity so that it is more or less than expected from the constituents. Many regulatory and experimental methods for predicting mixture toxicity rely on the use of a concentration addition model so that if interactions occur in mixtures, the risk posed may have been significantly underestimated. This is particularly concerning when considering environmental mixtures which are often highly complex and composed of indeterminate chemicals. Failure to accurately predict the effects chemicals will have if released into the environment, where they can form mixtures, can lead to unexpected detrimental effects on wildlife and ecosystems. The number of confounding factors that may alter the ecotoxicity of a mixture and the accuracy of predictive methods makes risk assessment of environmental mixtures a complex and intimidating task. With this in mind, this review aims show why accurate risk assessment of mixtures is vital by demonstrating the effect they can have on organisms in the environment. Furthermore, it also aims to look at the current challenges facing the assessment of mixture effects and examines future areas of focus that seek to develop methodologies more suitable for environmental mixtures.},

It provides a framework to advance the environmental epidemiology field that has until now focused almost exclusively on single-exposure health effects. The exposome includes an external domain, measured by methods including geo-spatial modelling, questionnaire and biomonitoring of external exposures while the internal domain is commonly assessed through molecular omics platforms. The internal domain, in part, reflects the biological response to the external domain. New statistical frameworks are required to integrate and assess exposome-health effects. The pregnancy period is a key starting point to describe the dynamic exposome, due to its heightened sensitivity and potential lifetime impact. A handful of studies have started to move towards an exposome approach in assessing the effects of the multiple exposures during pregnancy on child development. New research projects are underway to test the exposome approach on a large scale.},

However, investigating the effect of interactions among these ECs can be challenging. We introduced a combination of the classical exposure-mixture Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression and a machine-learning method termed Signed iterative Random Forest (SiRF) to discover synergistic interactions between ECs that are (1) associated with higher odds of ASD diagnosis, (2) mimic toxicological interactions, and (3) are present only in a subset of the sample whose chemical concentrations are higher than certain thresholds. In a case-control Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and Environment (CHARGE) study, we evaluated multiordered synergistic interactions among 62 ECs measured in the urine samples of 479 children in association with increased odds for ASD diagnosis (yes vs no). WQS-SiRF identified two synergistic two-ordered interactions between (1) trace-element cadmium (Cd) and the organophosphate pesticide metabolite diethyl-phosphate (DEP); and (2) 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP-246) and DEP. Both interactions were suggestively associated with increased odds of ASD diagnosis in the subset of children with urinary concentrations of Cd, DEP, and TCP-246 above the 75th percentile. This study demonstrates a novel method that combines the inferential power of WQS and the predictive accuracy of machine-learning algorithms to discover potentially biologically relevant chemical–chemical interactions associated with ASD.},

	abstract = {In contrast to the general research attitude in the basic sciences, environmental sciences are often goal-driven and should provide the scientific basis for risk assessment procedures, cleanup, and precautionary measures and finally provide a decision support for policy and management. Hence, the prominent role of mechanistic studies in ecotoxicology is not only to understand the impact of pollutants on living organisms but also to deduce general principles for the categorization and assessment of effects. The goal of this review is, therefore, not to provide an exhaustive coverage of modes of toxic action and their underlying biochemical mechanisms but rather to discuss critically the application of this knowledge in ecotoxicological risk assessment. Knowing the mechanism or, at least, the mode of toxic action is indispensable for developing descriptive and predictive models in ecotoxicology. This review seeks to show the crucial role of target sites, interactions with the target site(s), and mechanisms for an adequate and efficient ecotoxicological risk assessment. Emphasis in the discussion is on target effect concentrations (or target occupancy), species selectivity and species sensitivity, time perspective of effect studies, Quantitative Structure−Activity Relationships (QSAR), and mixture toxicity. A particular focus of this review is on multiple mechanisms. Although the illustrative examples were mainly taken from studies in aquatic ecotoxicology, the proposed conceptual approach is also in principle applicable and even particularly useful for soil and sediment systems. Recommendations for further research and developments include the use of internal effect concentrations and target site concentrations in site-specific risk assessment and as a mixture toxicity parameter as well as general considerations for the derivation of mechanistically meaningful QSAR and other predictive models.},

	abstract = {Heavy metal-induced cellular and organismal toxicity have become a major health concern in biomedical science. Indiscriminate use of heavy metals in different sectors, such as, industrial-, agricultural-, healthcare-, cosmetics-, and domestic-sectors has contaminated environment matrices and poses a severe health concern. Xenobiotics mediated effect is a ubiquitous cellular response. Oxidative stress is one such prime cellular response, which is the result of an imbalance in the redox system. Further, oxidative stress is associated with macromolecular damages and activation of several cell survival and cell death pathways. Epidemiological as well as laboratory data suggest that oxidative stress-induced cellular response following heavy metal exposure is linked with an increased risk of neoplasm, neurological disorders, diabetes, infertility, developmental disorders, renal failure, and cardiovascular disease. During the recent past, a relation among heavy metal exposure, oxidative stress, and signaling pathways have been explored to understand the heavy metal-induced toxicity. Heavy metal-induced oxidative stress and its connection with different signaling pathways are complicated; therefore, the systemic summary is essential. Herein, an effort has been made to decipher the interplay among heavy metals/metalloids (Arsenic, Chromium, Cadmium, and Lead) exposures, oxidative stress, and signal transduction, which are essential to mount the cellular and organismal response. The signaling pathways involved in this interplay include NF-κB, NRF2, JAK-STAT, JNK, FOXO, and HIF.},

	abstract = {Objectives

The specific objectives are threefold: to describe the biologically plausible mechanistic pathways by which exposure to particulate matter (PM) may lead to the adverse perinatal outcomes of low birth weight (LBW), intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), and preterm delivery (PTD); review the evidence showing that nutrition affects the biologic pathways; and explain the mechanisms by which nutrition may modify the impact of PM exposure on perinatal outcomes.
Methods

We propose an interdisciplinary conceptual framework that brings together maternal and infant nutrition, air pollution exposure assessment, and cardiopulmonary and perinatal epidemiology. Five possible albeit not exclusive biologic mechanisms have been put forth in the emerging environmental sciences literature and provide corollaries for the proposed framework.
Conclusions

Protecting the environmental health of mothers and infants remains a top global priority. The existing literature indicates that the effects of PM on LBW, PTD, and IUGR may manifest through the cardiovascular mechanisms of oxidative stress, inflammation, coagulation, endothelial function, and hemodynamic responses. PM exposure studies relating mechanistic pathways to perinatal outcomes should consider the likelihood that biologic responses and adverse birth outcomes may be derived from both PM and non-PM sources (e.g., nutrition). In the concluding section, we present strategies for empirically testing the proposed model and developing future research efforts.},

To simplify this process, we present the R package mpower for power analysis of observational studies of environmental exposure mixtures involving recently developed mixtures analysis methods. The components within mpower are also versatile enough to accommodate any mixtures methods that will be developed in future. The package allows users to simulate realistic exposure data and mixed-typed covariates based on public dataset such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey or other existing dataset from prior studies. Users can generate power curves to assess the trade-offs between sample size, effect size, and power of a design. This paper presents tutorials and examples of power analysis using mpower.},

This holistic concept of exposure provides a new framework to advance the understanding of complex and multifactorial diseases. Prospective pregnancy and birth cohort studies provide a unique opportunity for exposome research as they are able to capture, from prenatal life onwards, both the external (including lifestyle, chemical, social and wider community-level exposures) and the internal (including inflammation, metabolism, epigenetics, and gut microbiota) domains of the exposome. In this paper, we describe the steps required for applying an exposome approach, describe the main strengths and limitations of different statistical approaches and discuss their challenges, with the aim to provide guidance for methodological choices in the analysis of exposome data in birth cohort studies. An exposome approach implies selecting, pre-processing, describing and analyzing a large set of exposures. Several statistical methods are currently available to assess exposome-health associations, which differ in terms of research question that can be answered, of balance between sensitivity and false discovery proportion, and between computational complexity and simplicity (parsimony). Assessing the association between many exposures and health still raises many exposure assessment issues and statistical challenges. The exposome favors a holistic approach of environmental influences on health, which is likely to allow a more complete understanding of disease etiology.},

We linked data from birth records with census-tract–level air toxics data from the Environmental Protection Agency’s National Air Toxics Assessment model. We estimated the difference between observed and expected birth weights that theoretically would have followed a hypothetical intervention to reduce exposure to 6 airborne metals by decommissioning 3 coal-fired power plants in Milwaukee County prior to 2010. Using Bayesian g-computation, we estimated a 68-g (95\% credible interval: 25, 135) increase in birth weight following this hypothetical intervention. This example demonstrates the utility of our approach for using observational data to evaluate and contrast possible public health actions. Additionally, Bayesian g-computation offers a flexible strategy for estimating the effects of highly correlated exposures, addressing statistical issues such as variance inflation, and addressing conceptual issues such as the lack of interpretability of independent effects.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The burden of childhood and adult obesity disproportionally affects Hispanic and African-American populations in the US, and these groups as well as populations with lower income and education levels are disproportionately affected by environmental pollution. Pregnancy is a critical developmental period where maternal exposures may have significant impacts on infant and childhood growth as well as the future health of the mother. We initiated the "Maternal And Developmental Risks from Environmental and Social Stressors (MADRES)" cohort study to address critical gaps in understanding the increased risk for childhood obesity and maternal obesity outcomes among minority and low-income women in urban Los Angeles.
METHODS: The MADRES cohort is specifically examining whether pre- and postpartum environmental exposures, in addition to exposures to psychosocial and built environment stressors, lead to excessive gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention in women and to perturbed infant growth trajectories and increased childhood obesity risk through altered psychological, behavioral and/or metabolic responses. The ongoing MADRES study is a prospective pregnancy cohort of 1000 predominantly lower-income, Hispanic women in Los Angeles, CA. Enrollment in the MADRES cohort is initiated prior to 30 weeks gestation from partner community health clinics in Los Angeles. Cohort participants are followed through their pregnancies, at birth, and during the infant's first year of life through a series of in-person visits with interviewer-administered questionnaires, anthropometric measurements and biospecimen collection as well as telephone interviews conducted with the mother.
DISCUSSION: In this paper, we outline the study rationale and data collection protocol for the MADRES cohort, and we present a profile of demographic, health and exposure characteristics for 291 participants who have delivered their infants, out of 523 participants enrolled in the study from November 2015 to October 2018 from four community health clinics in Los Angeles. Results from the MADRES cohort could provide a powerful rationale for regulation of targeted chemical environmental components, better transportation and urban design policies, and clinical recommendations for stress-coping strategies and behavior to reduce lifelong obesity risk.},

	abstract = {Background: Prenatal phthalate exposure has been linked to reductions in fetal growth in animal and laboratory studies, but epidemiologic evidence is equivocal.
Objective: Examine the association between prenatal phthalate metabolite mixtures and fetal growth and evaluate whether that association is modified by fetal sex or omega-3 intake during pregnancy.
Methods: Analyses included 604 singleton pregnancies from TIDES, a prospective pregnancy cohort with spot urine samples and questionnaires collected in each trimester. Pregnancy-averaged phthalate exposure estimates were calculated as the geometric means of specific-gravity corrected phthalate metabolites. Fetal growth out­ comes included birthweight and length, and ultrasound-derived size and velocity of estimated fetal weight, femur length, abdominal and head circumferences in the second and third trimesters. We used a novel appli­ cation of quantile g-computation to estimate the joint association between pregnancy-averaged phthalate exposure and fetal growth, and to examine effect modification of that association by infant sex or omega-3 intake during pregnancy.
Results: There were few statistically significant differences in birth size and fetal growth by exposure. A onequartile increase in the phthalate mixture was modestly associated with reduced birthweight (β [95\% confi­ dence interval)]: − 54.6 [− 128.9, 19.7] grams; p = 0.15) and length (− 0.2 [− 0.6, 0.2] centimeters; p = 0.40). A one-quartile increase in the phthalate mixture was associated with reduced birth length in males (− 0.5 [− 1.0, 0.0] centimeters) but not for females (0.1 [− 0.2, 0.3] centimeters); interaction p = 0.05. The phthalate metabolite mixture was inversely associated with ultrasound-derived fetal growth among those with adequate omega-3 intake. For example, a one-quartile increase in the phthalate mixture was associated with reduced abdominal circumference in the third trimesters in those with adequate omega-3 intake (− 3.3 [− 6.8, 0.1] millimeters) but not those with inadequate omega-3 intake (1.8 [− 0.8, 4.5] millimeters); interaction p = 0.01.
Conclusion: Prenatal phthalate exposure was not significantly associated with fetal growth outcomes, with some exceptions for certain subgroups.},

	abstract = {There is growing interest in discovering interactions between multiple environmental chemicals associated with increased adverse health effects. However, most existing approaches (1) either use a projection or product of multiple chemical exposures, which are difficult to interpret and (2) cannot simultaneously handle multi-ordered interactions. Therefore, we develop and validate a method to discover shape-based interactions that mimic usual toxicological interactions. We developed the Multi-ordered explanatory interaction (Moxie) algorithm by merging the efficacy of Extreme Gradient Boosting with the inferential power of Weighted Quantile Sum regression to extract synergistic interactions associated with the outcome/odds of disease in an adverse direction. We evaluated the algorithm’s performance through simulations and compared it with the currently available gold standard, the signed-iterative random forest algorithm. We used the 2017–18 US-NHANES dataset (n = 447 adults) to evaluate interactions among nine per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances and five metals measured in whole blood in association with serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In simulations, the Moxie algorithm was highly specific and sensitive and had very low false discovery rates in detecting true synergistic interactions of 2nd, 3rd, and 4th order through moderate (n = 250) to large (n = 1000) sample sizes. In NHANES data, we found a two-order synergistic interaction between cadmium and lead detected in people with whole-blood cadmium concentrations and lead above 0.605 ug/dL and 1.485 ug/dL, respectively. Our findings demonstrate a novel validated approach in environmental epidemiology for detecting shape-based toxicologically mimicking interactions by integrating exposure-mixture regression and machine learning methods.},

In this paper we show that, for selection among normal linear models, the optimal predictive model is often the median probability model, which is defined as the model consisting of those variables which have overall posterior probability greater than or equal to 1/2 of being in a model. The median probability model often differs from the highest probability model.},
