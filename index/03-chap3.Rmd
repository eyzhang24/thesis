# Bayesian Regression Methods {#bayes}

## Motivation {#motivation}

We are interested in using Bayesian regression techniques to characterize the nature of non-additive interactions in exposure mixture studies. We begin by reviewing definitions for what constitutes an interaction and why interactions are relevant from public health and biological relevance. 

### Interactions from a statistical perspective

First, we define additivity and non-additivity in the traditional statistical paradigm [@siemiatycki_biological_1981]. Suppose we have two variables $x_1$ and $x_2$, and we want to consider their effect on some outcome of interest. If specifying [effect due to $x_1$ and $x_2$] = [effect due to $x_1$] + [effect due to $x_2$] can adequately capture this relationship, then we say that $x_1$ and $x_2$ each have an **additive effect** on the outcome and that there is no interaction between them. On the other hand, if there is variability in the outcome that can be captured by an additional term equal to some function of $x_1$ and $x_2$, we say that there is a **non-additive interaction** between $x_1$ and $x_2$. In this case, [effect due to $x_1$ and $x_2$] = [effect due to $x_1$] + [effect due to $x_2$] + [effect due to $f(x_1, x_2)$], where $f$ is a non-zero function.

For our sake, when we refer to "interaction," we mean any non-additive interaction. We consider such non-additive interactions to be complex, meaning that they are difficult to detect. To see why, let us consider running a linear regression for $Y$ on $x_1$ and $x_2$. The theoretical model would be defined as

$$
Y = \beta_0+\beta_1x_1+\beta_2x_2 + \beta_{12}f(x_1, x_2),
$$

\noindent where the $\beta$'s represent the effect sizes. We can see that the form of the interaction must be explicitly specified in the formulation of the model. Most commonly, a multiplicative interaction is assessed, where $f(x_1, x_2) = x_1*x_2$. However, a non-additive interaction can take on many different forms, the true nature of which is difficult to determine analytically. 

We used a two-predictor case above, but interactions can also exist between more variables (i.e., two-way by $f(x_1, x_2)$, three-way by $f(x_1, x_2, x_3)$, etc.). So, if we wanted to assess all possible interactions, the number to consider quickly becomes intractable in high-dimensional settings. For instance, consider modelling 10 predictors in the above linear regression setting. In order to be assessed, each interaction must be explicitly specified as a new term in the model. Even if we only considered one form for each interaction, including all possible two-way interactions would involve adding ${10 \choose 2} = 45$ additional terms to the model, and all possible three-way interactions would add ${10 \choose 3} = 120$ additional terms.

It is important also to acknowledge, here, that there is a limit to how many variables can be included in an interaction before it becomes incomprehensible to most humans. For instance, @halford_how_2005 suggest that there is a steep decline in interpretability from three- to four-way interactions, and that five-way interactions are only interpreted correctly at chance level [@halford_how_2005]. Hence, for practical purposes, we will limit our exploration to two- and three-way interactions. 

### Mechanistic and public health relevance

Thus far, we have discussed interactions within a statistical paradigm. However, in addition to being an interesting estimation challenge, non-additive interactions are also relevant in exposure mixture studies from both a mechanistic and public health point of view. 

From a mechanistic perspective, a non-additive statistical interaction between two chemical exposures suggests that these compounds may be functionally interacting with each other. Theoretical models propose that such interactions can be classified as either synergistic or antagonistic [@heys_risk_2016; @plackett_quantal_1952]. In a synergistic interaction, the joint effects of a mixture exceed the independent effects of each component. This usually occurs if a chemical induces an enzyme involved with the activation of a second chemical or if a chemical inhibits an enzyme that would have otherwise degraded a second chemical. For example, it has been shown that organophosphates slow the degradation of pyrethoids by inhibiting detoxifying enzymes — these two classes of chemicals are often found together in commercial insecticide mixtures [@hernandez_toxic_2013].

On the other hand, in an antagonistic interaction, the joint effects of a mixture are less than their independent effects. This can occur either through competition at the target site of an enzyme or through direct chemical reactions with each other. In general, synergistic interactions are more concerning in risk assessments, as they lead to underestimation of the true toxicity of a mixture. 

It should be noted, though, that while statistical interactions may provide some insight into how exposure mixtures are related to health, they cannot confirm their underlying biology [@vanderweele_tutorial_2014]. If the goal is to assess a meaningful biological interaction, then the discovery of a statistical interaction should be followed up by a functional study. 

Now, from a public health perspective, we might be interested in how exposure mixtures interact with other covariates, or, in other words, how social and health factors might mediate the relationship between a health outcome and chemical exposures [@vanderweele_tutorial_2014]. In our case, we can include these additional covariates in the exposure mixture model, where, statistically, they would contribute to the model in the same manner as another chemical exposure: a predictor. A statistical interaction in our model between a covariate and an exposure would indicate that the *magnitude* of the effect of reducing the level of an exposure might differ across various levels of the covariate. This finding could be relevant to public health policy makers, as the potential benefit of regulating a pollutant might differ across groups. For instance, it has been suggested that nutritional intake may modify susceptibility to chemical exposures [e.g., @kannan_exposures_2006; @kordas_interactions_2007].

In many cases, we might assess a covariate related to health inequity, such as socioeconomic status. We provide a cautionary comment, here, that an interaction term should not be the *sole* measure used to measure a health disparity [@ward_how_2019]. In this case, we should first consider the independent, additive association between the covariate and levels of exposure or rates of a health outcome, in order to contextualize the meaning of a potential interaction term. 


## Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) {#bkmr}

In this section, we introduce the theory of BKMR. First, we define the notation that we will be using for kernel machine regression:

<!-- -   observations are from $i = 1, \dots ,n$ -->

-   $X_m$ is an exposure in the exposure matrix $\textbf{X}$ with $m = 1, \dots, M$
-   $\textbf{x}_i$ is a vector of values for a single observation in $\textbf{X}$ with $i = 1, \dots, n$
-   $x_{im}$ is the $i$th observation of $X_m$
-   $\textbf{z}_i$ is a vector of covariates for a single observation in the matrix $\textbf{Z}$, which contains a set of covariates, with $i = 1, \dots, n$
-   $Y_i$ is an observation of $\textbf{Y}$, measuring the health outcome in this case
-   $h(\cdot)$ is the flexible function relating $\textbf{x}$ to $\textbf{Y}$
-   $k$ is the kernel function, the Gaussian in this case
-   $\textbf{K}$ is the $n \times n$ kernel matrix, with $(i, j)$th element $k(\textbf{x}_i, \textbf{x}_j)$
-   $\rho$ is the parameter which controls smoothnessm, associated with the kernel function
-   $\tau$ is the parameter multiplied by the kernel matrix to relate $\textbf{K}$ to $h$
-   $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{\textbf{z}}$ is a vector of the weights on the covariates, and
-   $\boldsymbol\varepsilon_i \overset{\mathrm{iid}}{\sim} N(0, \sigma^2)$ are the residuals of the response.

And, we define the notation that we will be using specific to BKMR: 

-   $r_m=1/\rho_m$ is an augmented variable in $\textbf{r}$ in the kernel matrix, controlling smoothness
-   $\delta_m$ is an indicator variable in $\boldsymbol\delta$ which represents inclusion in the model
-   $\mathcal{S}_g$ is a group of partitioned predictors with ${g=1,\dots,G}$
-   $\{\delta_m|\textbf{x}_m \in{\mathcal{S}_g}\}$ is an indicator variable in $\boldsymbol\delta_{\mathcal{S}_g}$ which represents inclusion of a parameter in group $g$ in the model
-   $\pi$ is the prior probability of inclusion of a predictor in the model, and
-   $\lambda \equiv \tau\sigma^{-2}$ is a convenient way to define the prior on $\tau$.

### Kernel machine regression

We begin by introducing kernel machine regression, with attention to its specific implementation in BKMR. First proposed by @nadaraya_estimating_1964 and @watson_smooth_1964, kernel machine regression is a nonparametric regression technique that can be used to capture non-linear effects and non-additive interactions. In this introduction, we follow the presentation of kernel machine regression provided by @bobb_bayesian_2015.

To contextualize this method, we start at the typical linear regression setting,

$$
Y_i = \textbf{x}_i^\top \boldsymbol{\beta}_{\textbf{x}} + \textbf{z}_i^\top \boldsymbol{\beta}_{\textbf{z}} + \varepsilon_i,
$$

\noindent where $Y_i$ measures a health outcome at a given point, $\textbf{x}_i = [x_{i1},\dots,x_{iM}]$ is a vector of M exposures, $\textbf{z}_i$ is a vector of covariates, $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{\textbf{x}}$ and $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{\textbf{z}}$ are vectors of weights for the exposures and covariates, respectively, and $\varepsilon_i$ is a random variable from $\boldsymbol\varepsilon \overset{\mathrm{iid}}{\sim} N(0, \sigma^2)$. We can see that this function assumes that there is a linear relationship between the exposure and the response, and that the combined effects of multiple exposures are additive.

Kernel machine regression defines this relationship using a flexible function $h: \mathbb{R}^M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, where

$$
Y_i = h(\textbf{x}_i) + \textbf{z}_i^\top \boldsymbol{\beta}_{\textbf{z}} + \varepsilon_i.
$$

\noindent Here, $h(\cdot)$ is represented by the function $k(\cdot, \cdot)$, a kernel. The kernel controls the covariance, or the similarity, between values of $h(\textbf{x})$ and as such ensures that points near each other on the prediction surface will have similar values --- or, in other words, that the prediction surface will be smooth. In the case of kernel machine regression, we define a positive definite kernel where $k: \mathbb{R}^M\times \mathbb{R}^M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Note also that covariates are assumed to have a linear, non-additive effect on the response. 

There are many choices of functions for $k$. BKMR uses the Gaussian kernel, also known as the radial basis function or, sometimes, the squared exponential kernel. The Gaussian kernel is defined as

$$
k(\textbf{x}, \textbf{x}') = \textrm{exp}\bigg\{
-\frac{||\textbf{x}-\textbf{x}'||^2}{\rho} \bigg\},
$$

\noindent where $||\textbf{x}-\textbf{x}'||^2 = \sum_{m=1}^M{(x_{m}-x_{m}')^2}$ for a set of exposure values $\textbf{x}$ and the exposure values of another subject $\textbf{x}'$, and $\rho$ is a tuning parameter that controls the relationship between the correlation between two points and their distance. Greater values of $\rho$ will enforce more dependence between points and make the resulting function smoother. $h$ is related to $k$ by a multiplicative constant $\tau$, a tuning parameter which controls the vertical scale of $h$.

Now that we have defined $h$ and $k$, we can think about how to characterize the relationship between our response and exposures Kernel machine regression is a nonparametric technique because it does not specify a functional form for this relationship. Hence, we will think about estimating the response at a particular query point. Operationally, @muller_weighted_1987 demonstrated that kernel machine regression uses a weighted average of all the observations in the dataset to estimate the response, defined as

$$
\bar{Y} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^nw_iY_i}{\sum_{i=1}^nw_i},
$$

\noindent with some set of weights $\{w_i\}_{i=1}^n$. Intuitively, we want to weight the observations that are closer to the query point more heavily. Using the Gaussian kernel as a weight allows us to achieve this. Replacing the weight with the Gaussian kernel, we get

$$
\bar{Y} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n k(\textbf{x}, \textbf{x}_i) Y_i}
{\sum_{i=1}^n k(\textbf{x}, \textbf{x}_i)}.
$$

As we move through the predictor space, we can think of the prediction as a continuous moving average of local points in the dataset. The correlation between two values of $h$ is defined as

$$
\textrm{cor}(h_i, h_j) = \textrm{exp} \bigg\{-\frac{||
\textbf{x}_{i}-\textbf{x}_{j}||^2}{\rho} \bigg\},
$$

\noindent which allows us to see that values of $h$ near each other will have a higher correlation and thus similar values. This is also why the resulting function is smooth.

### Connection to mixed models

It is useful to make connections between this definition of kernel machine regression and mixed models. @liu_semiparametric_2007 demonstrated this by representing $h(\textbf{x})$ as following a Gaussian process probability distribution,

$$
h(\textbf{x}) \sim \mathcal{GP}(\textbf{0}, \tau k(\textbf{x}, \textbf{x}')),
$$

\noindent with covariance function $k$, where $\textbf{x}$ is a vector of the exposure values, and $\textbf{x}'$ contains the exposure values of another subject. A Gaussian process is a collection of random variables, of which any finite number follow a multivariate normal distribution [@schulz_tutorial_2018]. Here, we assume that the expected value of the $h$ function with input $\textbf{x}$ is $\textbf{0}$. We use $k$ for the covariance function, which represents the dependence between the function values with inputs $\textbf{x}$ and $\textbf{x}'$: $k(\textbf{x}, \textbf{x}') = \mathbb{E}[(h(\textbf{x})- \textbf{0}) (h(\textbf{x}')- \textbf{0})]$.

Now, we can represent $h$ as a collection of variables from a Gaussian process. $h$ follows a multivariate normal distribution,

$$
h({\textbf{x}}) \sim N(\textbf{0}, \tau\textbf{K}),
$$

\noindent where $h({\textbf{x}}) = [h(\textbf{x}_1), h(\textbf{x}_2), \dots, h(\textbf{x}_n)]^\top$ and $\textbf{K}$ is the kernel matrix. The kernel matrix is an $n \times n$ matrix with $(i, j)$th element $k(\textbf{x}_i, \textbf{x}_j)$. Now, returning back to the regression view, we can think of each $Y_i$ as following the distribution,

$$
Y_i \overset{\mathrm{ind}}{\sim} N(h(\textbf{x}_i) + \textbf{z}_i^\top \boldsymbol{\beta}_{\textbf{z}}, \sigma^2) \text{ for } i = 1,\dots,n,
$$

\noindent where $\sigma^2$ comes from the variance of the residuals. Here, $h$ can be interpreted as a random effect. 

### Toy example {#bkmrtoy}

In the following section, we illustrate kernel machine regression with a toy example.

Consider the following case where we want to model the relationship between a single predictor and a response variable. Suppose the true relationship between $x$ and $Y$ is defined $Y = e^{\frac{x}{10}} + 2\sin(\frac{x}{2})$. We simulate 51 equally spaced observations of $x$ from 0 to 25, with error $\varepsilon_i \overset{\text{iid}}\sim N(0, 0.25)$.

```{r toy1, fig.cap = "Non-linear data with a true relationship (orange) and a fitted linear regression (blue).", out.width = '75%', echo = FALSE}
include_graphics(path = "figures/ch3_toy1.png")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:toy1) illustrates the shape of our simulated non-linear data and the fit proposed by a simple linear regression. We can observe that the linear regression fails to capture the true non-linear relationship. In this case, this would lead to an underestimation of the true association between $x$ and $Y$. Now, we will try to capture this relationship using kernel machine regression.

```{r toy2, fig.cap="A query point of 12.5 and the weights of neighboring observations based on a Gaussian kernel", out.width = '75%', echo = FALSE}
include_graphics(path = "figures/ch3_toy2.png")
```

To visualize how kernel machine regression works as a moving weighted average, we can consider a query point of 12.5. Figure \@ref(fig:toy2) identifies the query point and assigns corresponding weights to the neighboring points based on a normal distribution, which shares the same density as the Gaussian kernel. In this case, we will specify $\rho = 2$, which is synonymous with assigning the weights using a normal distribution with $\sigma^2=1$. We can see how an appropriate estimate for $h(12.5)$ can be obtained by taking a weighted average of the $Y$'s, with those observations nearby weighted the most heavily.

<!-- Note to self, bandwidth represent four times the quartiles of the probability density. In the case of a Gaussian kernel, the bandwidth represents $\frac{8}{3}\sigma$, so using an sd of 1 translates to bandwidth of 8/3 -->

```{r toy3, fig.cap="Fitted kernel machine regression (blue) with $\\rho=2$ compared to the true relationship (orange).", out.width = '75%', echo = FALSE}
include_graphics(path = "figures/ch3_toy3.png")
```

Now, we fit a kernel machine regression on this data with $\rho=2$ using the `stats` package in R [@r_core_team_r_2013]. We can see in Figure \@ref(fig:toy3) that kernel machine regression captures the complex non-linear relationship between $Y$ and $x$ and closely follows the true relationship. We do note, though, that the estimation is less precise at the tails, where there is less information provided by local observations. We can also use this example to consider the effect of various values of $\rho$ on the smoothness of the $h$ function.

```{r toyrho, fig.cap="Fitted kernel machine regression with $\\rho=0.02$ and $\\rho=50$.", out.width = '100%', echo = FALSE}
include_graphics(path = "figures/ch3_toyrho.png")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:toyrho) demonstrates the effect of relatively smaller and larger values of $\rho$ on $h$. Decreasing the value of $\rho$ allows kernel machine regression to overfit to the noise in the data by relaxing the dependence of neighboring values of $h$ to each other. On the other hand, increasing the value of $\rho$ enforces more dependence in $h$ and as such results in an underfit estimation. Hence, the choice of $\rho$ has a strong effect on the performance of kernel machine regression.

### Variable selection

Now that we have defined kernel machine regression, we can extend it to the Bayesian paradigm. @bobb_bayesian_2015 showed that the Bayesian approach can outperform frequentist kernel machine regression because simultaneous variable selection and estimation can better capture the exposure-response relationship. In this section, we discuss the two methods for Bayesian variable selection in BKMR: hierarchical variable selection and component-wise variable selection [@bobb_bayesian_2015].

In order to perform variable selection, we define a parameter that puts a weight on each exposure. Each weight controls the degree to which its associated exposure contributes to the model. In component-wise selection, we do this by augmenting the kernel function as

$$
k(\textbf{x}, \textbf{x}'|\textbf{r}) = \text{exp}\bigg\{ -\sum_{m=1}^Mr_m(x_m-x_m')^2 \bigg\},
$$

\noindent where $\textbf{r}=[r_1,\dots,r_M]^\top$. We define $r_m=1/{\rho_m}$, the inverse of the tuning parameter $\rho_m$ for each $\textbf{x}_m$. Now, we can imagine that an exposure that is not closely associated with the response will be be assigned a value of $r_m$ close to 0, which corresponds to a larger value of $\rho_m$. This larger value of $\rho_m$ means that this exposure would contribute less to the exposure-response relationship, as depicted in the second panel of Figure \@ref(fig:toyrho).

We now define the kernel matrix $\textbf{K}_{\textbf{X},\textbf{r}}$ as the $n\times n$ matrix with $(i,j)$th element $k(\textbf{x}, \textbf{x}'|\textbf{r})$. To allow $r_m$ to equal 0 with non-zero probability, we first define an indicator variable determining whether or not a predictor is included in the variable, which is distributed as

$$
\delta_m \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\pi),
$$

\noindent where $\pi$ is the prior probability of inclusion. Now, we can assume a "slab-and-spike" prior on $r_m$, distributed as

$$
r_m|\delta_m \sim \delta_mf(r_m) + (1-\delta_m)P_0,
$$

\noindent where $f(\cdot)$ is some pdf with support $\mathbb{R}^+$, and $P_0$ denotes the density with point mass at 0.

While this process of component-wise variable selection works well in a typical multiple regression setting, it can lead to unreliable estimates in situations where the exposures are highly correlated with each other, which is common in exposure mixture studies. In this case, the correlated components contribute similar information to the model, and component-wise variable selection is not able to distinguish which exposure is important. BKMR deals with this problem by introducing hierarchical variable selection.

Hierarchical variable selection involves partitioning the predictors $\textbf{x}_1, \dots, \textbf{x}_M$ into $G$ groups, denoted $\mathcal{S}_g$ with $g = 1,\dots,G$. These groups should be selected by the user based on prior knowledge, with the aim of keeping within-group correlation high and between-group correlation low. For instance, consider a situation with 4 chemicals, Hg, Pb, As, and Sn. If Hg, Pb, and As were strongly correlated with each other and each weakly correlated with Sn, we might define $\mathcal{S}_1=\{\textrm{Hg, Pb, As}\}$ and $\mathcal{S}_1=\{\textrm{Sn}\}$.

The indicators from $r_m|\delta_m$ are now distributed as

\begin{gather*}
\boldsymbol\delta_{\mathcal{S}_g} | \omega_g \sim 
\text{Multinomial}(\omega_g, \boldsymbol\pi_{\mathcal{S}_g}), g=1,\dots,G,\\
\omega_g \sim\text{Bernoulli}(\pi),
\end{gather*}

\noindent where $\boldsymbol\delta_{\mathcal{S}_g}=\{\delta_m|\textbf{x}_m \in{\mathcal{S}_g}\}$ and $\boldsymbol\pi_{\mathcal{S}_g}$ are vectors of indicator variables and prior probabilities, respectively, of a exposure $\textbf{x}_m$ in group $\mathcal{S}_g$ entering the model. By this approach, at most one exposure in each group is allowed to enter the model.

While hierarchical variable selection resolves the issue of multicollinearity, it requires specifying subgroups of predictors a priori and assumes that one exposure in each group can capture the information of the rest. Hence, care should be taken to justify the partitioning of exposures when taking this approach. 

Note also that the posterior means of $\delta_m$ generated from these variable selection procedures represent the posterior probability of inclusion of $\textbf{x}_m$. We can interpret these posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs) as measures of the relative importance of each exposure These measures can be used to understand the contribution of each exposure to the health outcome of interest in the model.

### Prior specification

In this section, we specify the default prior distributions and parameters used by the BKMR algorithm [@bobb_bayesian_2015].

BKMR, by default, assumes $\rho_m=1/r_m \sim \text{Unif}(a_r,b_r)$, a flat prior between $a_r$ and $b_r$ for which the default values are 0 and 100, respectively [@bobb_introduction_2017]. This defines the prior probability of $\rho$ as equally distributed across any value from 0 to 100. This inverse of this prior corresponds to the slab component of the "slab-and-spike" prior, where $r_m|\delta_m \sim \delta_m\text{Unif}^{-1}(a_r, b_r) + (1-\delta_m)P_0$. As a flat prior, this distribution should be chosen when we have no prior knowledge about the smoothness of the exposure-response function, with hyperparameters $a_r$ and $b_r$ selected to represent the range of values we expect $\rho$ to potentially span.

We have seen that the smoothness of a kernel machine regression responds strongly to different values of $r_m=1/\rho$, and, accordingly, the model fit of BKMR is sensitive to their prior distribution. In general, the PIPs generated from the variable selection procedure are particularly sensitive to this prior, though their relative importance tends to remain stable [@bobb_statistical_2018]. As such, the BKMR algorithm also offers the options to define uniform and gamma priors for the $r_m=1/\rho$. 

<!-- *these choices may make more sense, as rho has an exponential relationship? confused about this* -->

Moreover, BKMR assumes that the prior probability of including a predictor ($\delta_m$) or group of predictors ($\omega_g$) in the model is distributed $\pi \sim \text{Beta}(a_\pi, b_\pi)$. The default hyperparameters are $a_\pi=b_\pi=1$, which represent a flat, uninformative prior between 0 and 1. When the hierarchical selection approach is applied, equal values for $\boldsymbol\pi_{\mathcal{S}_g}$, the probabilities of inclusion for each component in group $\mathcal{S}_g$, are assumed.

Finally, BKMR assumes that the inverse of the variance of the residuals is distributed $\sigma^{-2} \sim \text{Gamma}(a_\sigma, b_\sigma)$, with default values of $a_\sigma=b_\sigma=0.001$, and that the vertical scale of $h$ is parameterized by $\lambda \equiv \tau\sigma^{-2} \sim \text{Gamma}(a_\lambda, b_\lambda)$, with default values of $a_\lambda, b_\lambda$ such that the mean and variance of $\lambda$ are both equal to 10.

### The MCMC algorithm

Briefly, we discuss the algorithm used to find the solution in the BKMR package [@bobb_bayesian_2015; @bobb_statistical_2018], with commentary on its implications for the model fitting process.

BKMR uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm with a mix of Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings samplers to estimate the posterior distributions of the parameters. In particular, a Gibbs step is used to update the distribution of $\sigma^2$ while a Metropolis-Hastings step is used to update the distribution of $\lambda$. For component-wise and hierarchical variable selection, $(\textbf{r}, \boldsymbol\delta, \boldsymbol\omega)$ are sampled jointly using a Metropolis-Hastings sampling scheme.

While each distribution generated by the Gibbs step is always accepted, the distributions for $\lambda$ and $r_m$ generated by the Metropolis-Hastings steps are accepted based on an acceptance rate [@wagaman_probability_2021]. The standard deviation of the proposal distribution controls the acceptance rate and as such acts as a tuning parameter [@bobb_example_2017]. In general, increasing the standard deviation leads to lower acceptance rates. Acceptance rates that are too low lead to slower convergence, but rates that are too high can cause convergence to a non-optimal distribution.

A major computational limitation of BKMR is that at each iteration of the MCMC algorithm, the $n \times n$ augmented kernel matrix $\textbf{K}_{\textbf{Z},\textbf{r}}$ must be inverted multiple times. To offset this, BKMR can employ a Gaussian predictive process which involves specifying a set of $l$ points, or "knots," that are a subset of the predictor space. The vector of predictors can be approximated by projection onto this lower dimensional space, which allows the algorithm to perform inversions on an $l\times l$ matrix. A general suggestion is to use this approach to speed up the algorithm when $n$ is large and to specify $l\approx n/10$ [@bellavia_statistical_2021].

## Bayesian semiparametric regression (BSR) {#bsr}

In this section, we introduce the theory of BSR. First, we define the notation that we will be using for spline regression:

- $X_m$ is a predictor variable in the predictor matrix $\textbf{X}$ with $m=1,\dots,M$, measuring exposure variables or covariates
- $\textbf{x}_i$ is a vector of values for a single observation in $\textbf{X}$ with $i=1,\dots,n$
- $\textbf{z}_i$ is a vector of covariates for a single observation in the matrix $\textbf{Z}$, which contains a set of covariates, with $i = 1, \dots, n$
- $Y_i$ is an observation of $\textbf{Y}$, measuring the health outcome in this case
- $f(\cdot)$ relates $\textbf{x}_i$ to $Y_i$ by a set of basis functions, $b_j(X)$
- $\beta_j$ is a weight on the $j$th basis function
- $P$ is the order of the basis expansion
- $K$ is a set of $\xi_k$, $k=1,\dots,K$, interior knots defining $K+1$ disjoint intervals, and
- $\boldsymbol\varepsilon_i \overset{\textrm{iid}}\sim N(0,\sigma^2)$ are the residuals of the response.

And, we define the notation that we will be using specific to BSR:

- $\widetilde{X}_m$ is a $d$-dimensional basis function expansion of $X_m$
- $\widetilde{X}_{m_1m_2}$ is a $d^2$-dimensional basis expansion of the interaction between $X_{m_1}$ and $X_{m_2}$
- $f^{(h)}(\cdot)$, where $h=1,\dots,H$ are a set of functions that sum up to $f(\cdot)$
- $\boldsymbol\zeta = \{\zeta_{mh}\}$ is an indicator for whether the $m$th predictor is included in the $h$th function
- $\boldsymbol\beta_S^{(h)}$ is a vector of all the coefficients on the predictors in function $h$
- $\sigma^2_{\boldsymbol\beta}$ is the prior variance on the coefficients, and
- $\boldsymbol\Sigma_{\boldsymbol\beta}$ is a diagonal matrix with the variances of the multivariate slab prior, $\sigma^2\sigma^2_{\boldsymbol\beta}$, on the diagonals.


### Spline regression

We begin by introducing spline regression, with attention to its specific implementation in BSR. Spline regression is a semiparametric regression technique that can be used to capture non-linear effects. In this introduction, we follow the presentation of spline regression provided by @antonelli_estimating_2020, with additional details and explanation from @hastie_elements_2009.

BSR uses spline regression to define the regression relationship as

$$
Y_i = f(\textbf{x}_i) + \textbf{z}_i^\top \boldsymbol{\beta}_{\textbf{z}} +\varepsilon_i,
$$

\noindent where $f$ is defined by a set of basis functions on the exposures, $\textbf{x}_i$, $\textbf{z}_i$ and $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{\textbf{z}}$ are the covariates and their associated weights, and $\varepsilon_i$ is a random variable from $\boldsymbol\varepsilon \overset{\mathrm{iid}}{\sim} N(0, \sigma^2)$. BSR uses natural spline bases. In order to understand how these are constructed, we start with a broad definition of basis expansions, before exploring linear, cubic, and then natural spline bases. 

We determine the basis expansion by considering a piece-wise function of $X_m$ with some order $P$ and some set of $K$ knots defining $K+1$ disjoint intervals. BSR places knots at uniformly sized quantiles within the boundaries of $X_m$. The most commonly used orders are $P=1,2,\textrm{and } 4$, the constant, linear, and cubic splines, respectively. To begin, let us consider a continuous piece-wise linear spline basis (i.e., $P=2$) of a one-dimensional $X$ with two interior knots. In this case, we use the following four basis functions:

\nointerlineskip
\[
b_1(X)=1, \hspace{0.25in} b_2(X)=X, \hspace{0.25in} b_3(X)=(X-\xi_1)_+, \hspace{0.25in} b_4(X)=(X-\xi_2)_+,
\]

\noindent where $\xi_1$ and $\xi_2$ are the two interior knots, and $t_+$ denotes the positive part. These bases are used to construct the regression model $f(X)=\sum_{j=1}^4\beta_jb_j(X)$, which requires estimating $K+P=4$ parameters. We can check the continuity restrictions at the knots by seeing that $f(\xi_1^-)=\beta_1 + \xi_1\beta_2$ and $f(\xi_1^+)= \beta_1 + \xi_1\beta_2+ (\xi_1-\xi_1)\beta_3$ are equal, and likewise at the second knot.

Now, in the case of exposure mixtures, we want smoother functions that can capture the non-linear relationship between the response and the predictors. We can achieve this by increasing the order to $P=4$ and using a cubic spline, with continuous first and second derivatives at the knots. The cubic spline is the lowest-order spline for which knot-discontinuity cannot be detected by the human eye. For example, for one $X$ with two interior knots, we use the following six basis functions: 

\begin{gather*}
b_1(X)=1, \hspace{0.25in}b_2(X)=X, \hspace{0.25in}b_3(X)=X^2, \\
b_4(X)=X^3, \hspace{0.25in} b_5(X)=(X-\xi_1)^3_+, \hspace{0.25in} b_6(X)=(X-\xi_2)^3_+.
\end{gather*}

\noindent Now, the regression model is defined as $f(X)= \sum_{j=1}^6\beta_jb_j(X)$ and requires estimating $K+P=6$ parameters. It can be shown that $f'(\xi_i^-)= f'(\xi_i^+)$ and $f''(\xi_i^-)= f''(\xi_i^+)$, and so forth. 

However, the behavior of polynomials near the boundaries of $X$, where there is less information, can be erratic. Natural cubic splines, also referred to as just natural splines, address this by imposing an additional restriction of linearity at the boundaries of $X$. Paradoxically, this also leads to a simpler model with four fewer parameters to estimate. A general definition of the $K$ basis functions for a natural spline with interior knots $\xi_j$, $j=1,\dots,K$, is given by:

<!-- $$ -->
<!-- N_1(X)=1, \hspace{0.25in} N_2(X)=X, \hspace{0.25in} N_{k+2}(X)=d_k(X)-d_{K-1}(X),  -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- d_k(X)=\frac{(X-\xi_k)^3_+ - (X-\xi_K)^3_+}{\xi_K-\xi_k}. -->
<!-- $$ -->

\begin{gather*}
b_1(X)=1, \hspace{0.25in} b_2(X)=X, \hspace{0.25in} b_{k+2}(X)=d_k(X)-d_{K-1}(X), \\
d_k(X)=\frac{(X-\xi_k)^3_+ - (X-\xi_K)^3_+}{\xi_K-\xi_k}.
\end{gather*}

\noindent Here, the regression model is defined as $f(X) = \sum_{j=1}^K\beta_jb_j(X)$, with $K$ parameters. BSR uses natural splines to specify the regression relationship. 

### Toy example

In the following section, we illustrate spline regression using the same toy example used to introduce kernel machine regression. See Section \@ref(bkmrtoy) and Figure \@ref(fig:toy1) for details on the parameters used to generate simulated data. 

As in Section \@ref(bkmrtoy), we consider a case where we want to model the relationship between a single exposure and a response variable, where the true relationship between $x$ and $Y$ is defined as $Y = e^{\frac{x}{10}} + 2\sin(\frac{x}{2})$. We fit a series of linear, cubic, and then natural spline regressions to illustrate the general framework of a natural spline regression. 

```{r toy4, fig.cap="Linear spline regression (blue) with four knots (dotted lines) compared to the true relationship (orange).", out.width = '75%', echo = FALSE}
include_graphics(path = "figures/ch3_toy4.png")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:toy4) illustrates the fit proposed by a linear spline regression with order $P=2$. We can see that the implementation of knots allows for even a linear fit to capture more of the nuances in this nonlinear relationship, as compared to a standard linear regression. 

```{r toy5, fig.cap="Cubic spline regression (blue) with four knots (dotted lines) compared to the true relationship (orange).", out.width = '75%', echo = FALSE}
include_graphics(path = "figures/ch3_toy5.png")
```

However, this linear spline regression is still unable to fully estimate the nonlinearity in our example. Increasing the order to $P=4$ with a cubic spline regression offers additional flexibility. Figure \@ref(fig:toy5) illustrates the fit proposed by this model. Here, we can see the benefits of using a cubic polynomial relationship in a nonlinear setting: the estimated relationship is continuous at the knots, and the nonlinear relationship has been flexibly captured. 

```{r toy6, fig.cap="Natural spline regression (blue) with four knots (dotted lines) compared to the true relationship (orange).", out.width = '75%', echo = FALSE}
include_graphics(path = "figures/ch3_toy6.png")
```

Our final modification involves imposing linearity constraints on the boundaries of $x$ to implement a natural spline regression. Figure \@ref(fig:toy6) shows that the fit estimated using a natural spline regression. The fitted line is only slightly different than that proposed by a cubic spline regression in Figure \@ref(fig:toy5). The most noticeable difference is that the slopes of the tails of the natural spline regression are less extreme than for the cubic spline regression. 

```{r toybounds, fig.cap="Natural and cubic spline regression (blue) compared to the true relationship (orange) extrapolated outside the bounds of $x$ (dotted lines).", out.width = '100%', echo = FALSE}
include_graphics(path = "figures/ch3_toybounds.png")
```

Extrapolation outside the scope of $x$ allows us to see the effect of the linearity constraints imposed by natural regression. Figure \@ref(fig:toybounds) demonstrates how the cubic spline regression behaves erratically outside the bounds of $x$, as the cubic polynomial lines tend toward $\pm\infty$, while the natural spline regression follows a more appropriate linear trend. As the natural spline regression is more reliable near the boundaries of $x$ and also simpler to estimate, BSR adopts the use of natural splines. 

### Model formulation in BSR

Now that we have defined natural splines, we introduce BSR, following the presentation in @antonelli_estimating_2020. We demonstrate the construction of $f$ in BSR by first assuming a two-dimensional case with exposures $X_1$ and $X_2$. We define

\begin{gather*}
f(X_1) = \widetilde{X}_1\boldsymbol{\beta}_1, \hspace{0.25in} f(X_2) = \widetilde{X}_2\boldsymbol{\beta}_2,\\
f(X_1,X_2) = \widetilde{X}_1\boldsymbol{\beta}_1 + \widetilde{X}_2\boldsymbol{\beta}_2 + \widetilde{X}_{12}\boldsymbol{\beta}_{12},
\end{gather*}

\noindent where $\widetilde{X}_m=[b_{m1}(X_m),\dots,b_{md}(X_m)]$ represents a $d$-dimensional basis function expansion for $m=1,2$, and $\widetilde{X}_{12}= [b_{11}(X_1)b_{21}(X_2), b_{11}(X_1)b_{22}(X_2), \dots, b_{1d}(X_1)b_{2d}(X_2)]$ represents a $d^2$-dimensional basis expansion of the interaction between $X_1$ and $X_2$. $d$ is an influential tuning parameter. BSR by default assumes that all exposures have the same number of degrees of freedom and uses the Watanabe-Akaike (WAIC) model selection criterion to select $d$, which approximates leave one out cross validation. Note that we must explicitly model the effect of the interaction term by assuming a multiplicative interaction between the basis functions of the predictors. 

Extending to the multi-dimensional setting, BSR assumes the following general model formulation: 

\begin{gather*}
f(\textbf{x}_i)= \sum_{h=1}^Hf^{(h)}(\textbf{x}_i), \\
f^{(h)}(\textbf{x}_i)= \sum_{m_1=1}^M\widetilde{x}_{im_1}\boldsymbol\beta_{m_1}^{(h)} + 
\sum_{m_1=2}^M\sum_{m_2<m_1}\widetilde{x}_{im_1m_2}\boldsymbol\beta_{m_1m_2}^{(h)} + \dots,
\end{gather*}

\noindent where $f^{(h)}(\textbf{x}_i)$ includes a summation of all $M$-way interactions. The inclusion of all $M$-way interactions makes the model far too overparameterized. Moreover, $f(\textbf{x}_i)$ is a sum of $k$ different functions $f^{(h)}(\textbf{x}_i)$ where a value for $H$ is selected in order to capture all exposure effects in the model. Each of the $H$ functions has the same functional form, and so the regression coefficients for a function $f^{(h)}(\textbf{x}_i)$ are only identifiable up to a constant — this means that there are multiple sets of coefficients that could be estimated from the same data. 

### Sparsity inducing priors

In order to handle the overparameterization and non-identifiability of the model, BSR implements multivariate sparsity inducing priors. In this section, we follow the presentation provided in @antonelli_estimating_2020. 

First, we define indicators $\boldsymbol\zeta=\{\zeta_{mh}\}$ representing whether the $m$th exposure is included in the $h$th function: 

\begin{align*}
P(\zeta_{mh}=1) &= \tau_h^{\zeta_{mh}}(1-\tau_h)^{1-\zeta_{mh}} 
I(A_h\not\subset A_{h'}\forall h'\neq h \textrm{ or } A_h=\{\}),\\
&\textrm{where } A_h=\{m:\zeta_h=1\}.
\end{align*}

\noindent Here, the indicators follow a Bernoulli distribution with prior probability of inclusion $\tau_h$. The posterior means of $\boldsymbol\zeta$, i.e. the PIPs, can be interpreted as measures of relative variable importance. We include an indicator function $I()$ that represents whether the function $h$ contains a unique set of predictors. This indicator ensures that no function contains exposures that are a subset of those in another function, $h'$, in which case this function would be redundant and thus removed from the model entirely. 

Now, we assume a multivariate slab-and-spike prior on the regression coefficients:

\begin{align*}
P(\boldsymbol\beta_S^{(h)}|\boldsymbol\zeta) &= \bigg(1-\prod_{m\in S}\zeta_{mh}\bigg)P_{\textbf{0}} +
\bigg(\prod_{m\in S}\zeta_{mh}\bigg) \psi_1(\boldsymbol\beta_S^{(h)}), \\
&\textrm{where } S \textrm{ is some subset of } {1, 2, \dots, m}.
\end{align*}

\noindent Here, $P_{\textbf{0}}$ denotes the density with point mass at $\textbf0$, and $\psi_1()$ is a multivariate normal distribution with mean $\textbf0$ and covariance $\boldsymbol\Sigma_{\boldsymbol\beta}$, a diagonal matrix with $\sigma^2\sigma_{\boldsymbol\beta}^2$ on the diagonals. 

### Prior specification

In this section, we discuss the priors and their default specifications in BSR [@antonelli_estimating_2020]. 

The priors on $\boldsymbol\Sigma_{\boldsymbol\beta}$, the diagonal matrix with $\sigma^2\sigma^2_{\boldsymbol\beta}$ on the diagonals, control the shrinkage of $\boldsymbol\beta_S^{(h)}$. Variable selection is sensitive to the choice of prior on this parameter, so BSR implements an empirical Bayes strategy to obtain a prior distribution for $\sigma^2_{\boldsymbol\beta}$ based on the data. While this is not a fully Bayesian approach, it has been shown that this strategy works better in practice [@antonelli_estimating_2020]. Additionally, the default prior for $\sigma^2$ is assumed to follow a $\textrm{Gamma}(0.001, 0.001)$ distribution. 

However, when there is a weak relationship between the exposures and relationship, the estimated prior variance for the slab $\sigma^2_{\boldsymbol\beta}$ can be very small. In this case, the shape of the slab approximates the point mass of 0 at the spike, and the PIPs become difficult to accurately estimate. BSR avoids this by imposing a lower bound on the variance. This is determined by establishing a constant value for $\tau_h$, the prior probability of inclusion, for all $h$ and then permuting the rows of $Y$ (i.e., breaking up the relationship). Then, a grid of values for $\sigma^2_{\boldsymbol\beta}$ are tested until some predefined threshold of the posterior probability of inclusion is obtained (e.g., 0.25 for a main effect and 0.05 for a two-way interaction). If the empirical Bayes estimate for $\sigma^2_{\boldsymbol\beta}$ is less than this lower bound, then the lower bound is used instead. 

Finally, BSR assumes that $\tau_h \sim \textrm{Beta}(L,\gamma)$, which defines the prior probability of including a predictor for all functions $h$. If $L$ is some predefined constant, and $\gamma=m$, the number of predictors, then the prior amount of sparsity should increase as the number of predictors increases [@antonelli_estimating_2020]. 

<!-- - $\tau_h \sim \textrm{Beta}(M,\gamma)$, where $\gamma=p$ and $M$ is some constant -->
<!--   - note that this leads to stronger penalization of higher-order interaction terms if scaled with $p$ if $\gamma \geq p+M-1$ -->

### The MCMC algorithm

We also briefly discuss the MCMC algorithm employed by BSR [@antonelli_estimating_2020]. 

BSR uses an MCMC algorithm to obtain posterior distributions of $\sigma^2$ and $\tau_h$. In particular, Gibbs samplers are employed to sample $\sigma^2$ and $\tau_h$ from their full distributions and to update $\boldsymbol\zeta$ and $\boldsymbol\beta_S^{(h)}$. Every $T$ MCMC iterations, BSR uses a Monte Carlo expectation maximization algorithm with a Gibbs sampler to update $\sigma^2_{\boldsymbol\beta}$. The empirical Bayes estimate is obtained once $\sigma^2_{\boldsymbol\beta}$ converges, at which point the MCMC runs conditional on this estimated variance. 

Notably, this algorithm must deal with the explicit specification of interaction terms in the model. Any additive univariate effect or lower-order interaction term is, by definition, a subset of some higher-order interaction term. As the MCMC algorithm searches the model space, it might accept a move to a higher-order interaction and get stuck in a local mode when, in reality, a simpler model should be preferred. BSR handles this challenge by imposing a constraint in the MCMC algorithm: if the inclusion of a $p$th order interaction term is being considered, then the algorithm must also evaluate all $(p-1)$th order models. If the truth is some lower-order model, then this strategy avoids the undesirable convergence to a local mode. When the model is complex, maintaining reversibility of updates under this strategy can be computationally challenging with a Gibbs sampler; in this case, using a Metropolis Hastings sampler is computationally faster [@antonelli_estimating_2020]. 

## Detecting interactions

In Section \@ref(motivation), we highlighted the challenges of analytically testing for the presence of interactions in exposure mixture studies. These challenges motivated a theoretical exploration of BKMR and BSR in Sections \@ref(bkmr) and \@ref(bsr). Now, we discuss and compare the options that BKMR and BSR provide for inference on the presence of interactions. We also include discussion on theoretical advantages and disadvantages to each. 

### BKMR

Since the flexible $h$ function in kernel machine regression allows us to forgo any assumptions about the nature of the relationship between the health outome and exposures, BKMR can potentially capture complex interactions between exposures The challenge with using BKMR to do this, however, is that there is no formal framework for conducting inference on the presence of interactions.

Currently, the most common approach to detecting interactions is through a qualitative assessment of visual diagnostic plots [@bobb_introduction_2017]. Two- or three-way interactions can be assessed by plotting the estimated exposure-response relation for one/two exposures at various quantiles of another exposure, while setting all other exposures at fixed quantile values. For instance, if we are interested in the interaction between $X_1$ and $X_2$, we can plot the estimated regression line against $X_1$ at the 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 quantiles of $X_2$ and vice versa. In the three-way case of $X_1$, $X_2$, and $X_3$, we can plot the estimated regression surface against $X_1$ and $X_2$ at the 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 quantiles of $X_3$. If the shape of the estimation changes meaningfully, then there might be evidence of an interaction. 

A slightly more formal inferential approach for two-way interactions involves using summary statistics [@bobb_introduction_2017; @bobb_example_2017]. In this case, we can calculate the difference in estimated response values for $X_1$ at two quantiles, say, 0.25 and 0.75, of $X_2$ and then generate a confidence interval. If we observe that the interval does not contain 0, then there is evidence of an interaction. The choice of quantiles here is important. If there is a parachute-like regression surface between the response and two exposures, the summary statistics might mask the true nature of the relationship. 

Notably, if we specify hierarchical variable selection to handle multicollinearity, then only one exposure in each a priori defined group can enter the model. If there exists some true interaction between exposures in one group, then BKMR will be unable to incorporate it into the final model. Moreover, interactions between exposures in separate groups can only be identified if both are selected into the final model based on their within-group PIPs. Hence, if detecting interactions is a goal when using BKMR with hierarchical variable selection, groups should be carefully selected, and the influence of group membership should be considered in model interpretation. 

### BSR

Providing formal inference on the presence of interactions was one of the primary motivations for the development of BSR. BSR explicitly incorporates interaction terms in its model formulation, and the model fitting process assigns PIPs for any $m$-dimensional interaction from the posterior means of the $\boldsymbol\zeta$ matrix. Such probabilities can be used as a quantifiable measure of the strength of a potential interaction. We can also compare PIPs for interactions with the PIPs for their individual components, which can be used to compare exposures' interactive effects with their marginal effects. 

The visualization and summary statistics approaches available in BKMR are also possible in BSR. In particular, it is helpful to follow up the identification of a potential interaction with a visual assessment using the estimated exposure-response relationship at fixed quantiles of other predictors. The major benefit of BSR is that the PIPs serve as a quantifiable uncertainty metric for the presence of interactions. 

### Differences between BKMR and BSR

We have explained how the inferential framework of BSR improves upon the BKMR approach for the detection of complex interactions. We also briefly compare general features of their model formulations. 

While BKMR is a fully nonparametric approach, BSR is a semiparametric approach because it makes distributional assumptions about the data (i.e., that the relationship can be adequately captured by a $d$-dimensional natural spline basis expansion). As BKMR uses the kernel technique, its implementation can become computationally intensive for datasets with large $n$, as it scales with $n^2$, while BSR is able to scale with $n$. 

BSR is highly sensitive to the choice of $d$, the degrees of freedom. While it employs a WAIC approach to selecting the best $d$, this parameter introduces an additional tuning step in the analysis. Both approaches can be highly sensitive to the specification of certain priors. BSR offers an empirical Bayes strategy for $\sigma^2_{\boldsymbol\beta}$, the variance of a exposure's probability of inclusion. On the other hand, the choice of prior on the influential smoothing parameter, $\rho$, in BKMR is up to the user. 

We also note that BKMR offers a hierarchical variable selection approach to dealing with collinearity between exposures While this is an additional decision that must be specified by the user, it offers a formal approach to dealing with collinear exposures. BSR does not explicitly account for collinearity in its model formulation, which can lead to erroneous interpretations of variable importance if unaccounted for. 

### Exposure-covariate interactions

<!-- Notes: complex vs. non-additive interaction, clarify in first section; decide what to do with covariates!! -->
