include_graphics("figures/surfaces/cp2.png")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:cordistsm) shows the detailed distribution of correlations in smaller size simulated datasets. 

```{r cordistsm, fig.cap = "Distributions of Spearman's correlation from 2100 smaller size (n=252) simulated datasets.", out.width = '100%', echo = FALSE}

```

Figures \@ref(fig:univexplg), \@ref(fig:univcovlg), and \@ref(fig:corsimslg) compare the marginal distributions of predictors and dependence structure between exposures of the observed dataset and simulated datasets of larger size (n=1000). 

```{r univexplg, fig.cap = "Distributions of exposures from observed data (blue) and simulated larger size (n=1000) datasets (gray).", out.width = '75%', echo = FALSE}

include_graphics(path = "figures/ch4_corr_lg_simorigdens.png")

Figure \@ref(fig:rsqcheck) visualizes the distribution of $R^2$ values in smaller and larger size simulated datasets.

```


Figure \@ref(fig:comparedf) compares the degrees of freedom selected using the WAIC criterion when fitting BSR using 5,000 MCMC iterations to 50,000 MCMC iterations. We ran this test on five smaller size datasets from the 16 scenarios containing interactions between exposures, as well as from the base case. 

```{r comparedf, fig.cap = "Test comparing WAIC selection of degrees of freedom from BSR models fit with either 5,000 or 50,000 MCMC iterations.", out.width = '100%', echo = FALSE}
include_graphics(path = "figures/test_waic2.png")
```

<!-- Here, we describe the formula for calculating the confidence interval of the difference in difference of the estimated response at the 0.75 and 0.25 quantiles of one chemical, while holding one or two other chemicals at their 0.75 and 0.25 quantiles and the rest of the chemicals at their 0.5 quantiles.  -->

```{r traceplots, fig.cap = "Examples of trace plots from smaller size BKMR (a) and BSR (b) as well as larger size BKMR (c) and BSR (d) in scenarios with larger effect size interactions between Hg and Ni.", echo = FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
include_graphics(path = "figures/traceplots/bksm_traceplotmerged.png")
```

Finally, we show why the order of chemicals in the confidence intervals we use to assess two-way interactions in BKMR is arbitrary. Let $\widehat{Y}(X1_a,X2_b)$ be the estimated response at the $a$th quantile of $X1$, the first chemical, the $b$th quantile of $X2$, the second chemical, while holding all other chemicals at their 0.5 quantiles. Then, the estimated confidence interval of the difference in the response $X_1$'s 0.75 and 0.25 quantiles, at both the 0.75 and 0.25 quantiles of $X_2$, can be shown to be equivalent to swapping the order of $X1$ and $X2$: 

\begin{multline}
[\widehat{Y}(X1_{0.75},X2_{0.75})-\widehat{Y}(X1_{0.25},X2_{0.75})] - [\widehat{Y}(X1_{0.75},X2_{0.25})-\widehat{Y}(X1_{0.25},X2_{0.25})] \\
= \widehat{Y}(X1_{0.75},X2_{0.75})-\widehat{Y}(X1_{0.25},X2_{0.75}) - \widehat{Y}(X1_{0.75},X2_{0.25})+\widehat{Y}(X1_{0.25},X2_{0.25}) \\

-\widehat{Y}(X1_{0.25},X2_{0.75}) +\widehat{Y}(X1_{0.25},X2_{0.25}) \\
