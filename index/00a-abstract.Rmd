In our modern world, we are constantly exposed to toxins, permeating our bodies through our food, skin, and lungs. Studies of environmental hazards have typically focused on identifying the health effects of single exposures. However, humans are invariably exposed to whole mixtures of exposures, and analyses of their joint effects can provide more accurate estimates of true health risk. The study of mixtures presents unique statistical challenges, though. This thesis explores the theory of emerging Bayesian regression techniques for quantifying the health risks of mixtures of pollutants. We use simulation studies to assess how modern statistical methods can detect interactions between multiple pollutants, and between pollutants and sociodemographic factors. We are keenly interested in combating habits of thought that associate outcomes with single, isolated causes, and progressing toward a study of health that acknowledges the relationality of our bodies to the environment and to each other.
