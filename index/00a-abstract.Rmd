We encounter toxins everyday â€” in the food we eat, the water we drink, and the air we breathe. Studies of environmental hazards have typically focused on identifying the health effects of single exposures. However, we are invariably exposed to whole mixtures of chemicals, and analyses of their joint effects can provide more accurate estimates of true health risk. The study of these exposure mixtures presents unique statistical challenges, though, including the detection of non-additive interactions. This thesis explores emerging flexible Bayesian regression models for quantifying a wide range of interactions between multiple pollutants, and between pollutants and sociodemographic factors. We use simulation studies to compare two such methods: Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) and Bayesian Semiparametric Regression (BSR). Based on our findings, we recommend first using BKMR for estimating the overall exposure-response relationship, and then using BSR for formal inference on potential interactions. However, our simulations also illustrate the difficulties of detecting interactions, particularly when they exist between chemicals and covariates, and when the sample size of the study population is small. As such, we highlight the importance of further methodological research in this area in order to progress toward a study of health that better acknowledges the relationality of our bodies to the environment and to each other.
